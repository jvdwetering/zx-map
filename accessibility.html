      <h2>Suggested red and green colours</h2>
      <p>
        The ZX calculus has always been a red / green calculus.
        This can cause problems if authors use shades of red and green that are hard to distinguish
        for people with CVD.
        We present here shades of red and green that should be distinguishable
        by people with any form of CVD, will print clearly in greyscale,
        and satisfies the W3 web standards for contrast against black text.
      </p>

      <h2>How to implement in LaTeX</h2>
      <p>
        Simply add the following two snippets of code to your preamble. The first defines the colours "zx_red" and
        "zx_green":

        <pre>
\definecolor{zx_red}{RGB}{232, 165, 165}
\definecolor{zx_green}{RGB}{216, 248, 216}
</pre>

        The second defines two node types "gn" and "rn" for use inside tikz diagrams:

        <pre>
\tikzstyle{gn}=[rectangle,rounded corners=0.8em,fill=zx_green,draw=Black,
  line width=0.8 pt,inner sep=3pt,minimum width=1.5em,minimum height=1.5em]
\tikzstyle{rn}=[rectangle,rounded corners=0.8em,fill=zx_red,draw=Black,
  line width=0.8 pt,inner sep=3pt,minimum width=1.5em,minimum height=1.5em]
</pre>

        We also encourage authors to demonstrate which colour is which.
        For example by including a tikz green node and red node immediately after first mentioning the colours:
        <pre>
  The ZX-calculus is built from red [red node] and green [green node] spiders.
</pre>

        Note that we encourage rounded rectangles over circles.
        And strongly encourage green Z nodes to be lighter in shade than red X nodes when printed in greyscale.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Alternative colours schemes:
      </h2>
      <p>
        The suggested colours above are by no means the only choice available.
        We require that contrast of black text against the colours is at least 4.5 under all CVD transformations,
        and suggest (but do not require) a lowest Delta-E value of at least 5.
        Here is another colour scheme suggested by the community:
      </p>
      <p>
        <div style="padding: 1em; background:  #ff8888">
          This is black text against red
        </div>
        <div style="padding: 1em; background:  #ccffcc">
          This is black text against green
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        Which passes the contrast test, but has a lower Delta-E than the suggested colours.
      </p>

      <h2>Livestreaming of workshops</h2>
      There are many reasons that someone may be unable to make it to a workshop in person.
      Here we give some recommendations on how to run a livestream,
      so that these people can still participate in the scientific discourse.

      <h3>
        Setting up a stream
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>There are many livestream providers available that only require setting up an account.
            These include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><a href="http://hangouts.google.com">Google Hangouts</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><a href="http://zoom.us">Zoom</a></p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Talks that involve slides can be managed by having the computer showing the slides also join the stream,
            and using the "share screen" feature.
            Note that joining nearby computers to the same stream can result in feedback,
            and microphones / speakers should be muted before doing so.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Talks that involve a speaker and a board can be presented using a webcam; ideally one on a cord that can be
            repositioned
            to follow the speaker.
            An external microphone is also a great help here.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            General discussions can be managed by projecting the stream onto the projector screen, like a slide
            presentation.
            Care should be taken that a microphone is positioned so that questions and answers can be heard.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Chairing a stream
      </h3>
      <p>
        There should always be a dedicated person whose task it is to manage the stream.
        This should also be on a rota,
        to spread the load and allow people to focus on the talks they are most interested in.
        The chair's duties include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Ensuring the livestream is still live </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Relaying questions from the stream to the speaker </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Relaying announcements to the stream (e.g. "we are having a break for lunch, and will start again in 75
            minutes") </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that those on the stream may well be in different timezones,
        so relative timings ("in 15 minutes") are preferred to absolute times ("at 2 o'clock".)
        Notes from previous conferences / livestreams are included in the sections below.

      <h2 id="notesfromrunningalivestreamduringthezxworkshopgrenoble2526february2019">Notes from running a livestream
        during the ZX workshop, Grenoble 25-26 February 2019</h2>

      <p>The stream:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The livestream was broadcast via the open ZX Google Hangout at
            https://hangouts.google.com/call/pk4lfcfxx5avtj5jrb36e5e3aue?no_rd</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Anyone with the URL could access the Hangout (as long as they were signed into Google). The URL was
            distributed on the conference scratch website, and via the ZX mailing list a few days in advance.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The "workshop account" (in practice the account of the organiser) left the Hangout at breaks and lunchtime,
            transmitting only during the sessions.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The set-up:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The main broadcasting computer was a 2018 MacBook Pro. Older computers were occasionally used and handled
            the stream fine. Despite initial worries, there was no problem with the laptop overheating or getting slow.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>An external webcam was plugged into the laptop, and set up on a table in front of where the speakers stood
            to give their talks. This meant the microphone was close to the speakers, and there was no issue with sound
            once the settings on the Hangout had been switched to capture sound from the webcam (this did not happen
            automatically like the video settings did).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>One person (generally the session chair, which in this case was the organiser) sat to the side at the
            front, with laptop at right angles to the speaker, at the end of the webcam wire and monitored the
            livestream for technical issues, checked that the speaker was in frame, and took any questions from the
            livestream chat. This worked well. The streaming laptop screen wasn't visible to either the speaker or the
            audience, so did not distract.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>There were three types of session, all with slightly different set-ups.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Talks with slides.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The webcam was pointed at the speaker, who was told where the field of view of the camera was and
                requested
                not to wander out of it. Speakers generally took this in their stride (or at least didn't appear visibly
                to
                be put off). The speaker's laptop was also connected to the Hangout and they shared their screen. This
                meant
                people on the Hangout could chose to full-screen either the slides or the picture of the speaker.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Dealing with audio feedback was an important issue. The full solutions on each laptop were the
                following:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Chair's laptop: connected to webcam, video and microphone set to capture from webcam, speakers on.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Speakers' laptop: connect to projector. Mute speakers before entering the Hangout. Once in,
                    immediately
                    mute microphone. Share screen (sometimes sharing only the application caused the Hangout to crash so
                    generally 'share entire screen' was preferred). Then start slides as usual for a presentation.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Questions: sometimes the livestream could not hear questions from the audience. Asking the speaker to
                repeat any questions solved that. For questions from the livestream, either the chair read out questions
                written into the chat, or else livestream attendees unmuted their microphones and asked through the
                chair's
                laptop. It worked quite well to turn the laptop around to the speaker so they could see the video of the
                person asking the question. There was a direct line of sight between the speaker, the webcam, and the
                chair+laptop.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Talks on the whiteboard.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Again the webcam was pointed at the speaker. This time, only the webcam image and sound was broadcast.
                This
                worked less well than slides talks. Challenges included getting the speaker to write large enough for
                the
                livestream to read, and to move the webcam around mid-talk to make sure the speaker and board were
                always
                in
                shot.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>In general, the whiteboard did not come over well on the webcam, and almost all detail was lost.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>One possible solution in future is to have a second person broadcasting from the speaker's location,
                who
                is
                copying the contents of the whiteboard onto their own laptop (eg using a digital pen) and sharing their
                screen.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

        </li>
        <li>Discussion sessions.

          <ul>
            <li>For these sessions the livestream was projected onto the main screen, and the webcam positioned in front
              of
              it pointing at the audience. This enabled two-way communication and involvement of the livestream
              participants. If auto-switching of the livestream was disabled, someone (eg the chair) needed to manually
              click on whichever livestream person was speaking in order to put them into the main window. This seemed
              to
              work well and the audio in both directions enabled reasonably free discussions.</li>
          </ul>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Comments:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Having the livestream increased the participation for minimal cost. It seemed to integrate
            well, and speaking as the person chiefly responsibly for running it, it required minimal faffing.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Next time, I would have a rota of different people monitoring the livestream, not just the same person
            (me)
            all the time.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>It would be good to find a way of giving general announcements in the livestream that people see when
            they
            join. E.g "we are running 20 mins behind schedule".</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Note that people join the livestream in different timezones, so announcements are better as "we will
            reconvene after lunch in 1 hour" rather than "at 1pm".</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Final comment: <strong>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</strong> that we move to make livestreaming a normal part of
        workshops within the community.</p>
