            <h2>Suggested red and green colours</h2>
            <p>
                The ZX calculus has always been a red / green calculus.
                This can cause problems if authors use shades of red and green that are hard to distinguish
                for people with CVD.
                We present here shades of red and green that should be distinguishable
                by people with any form of CVD, will print clearly in greyscale,
                and satisfies the W3 web standards for contrast against black text.
            </p>

            <div style="padding: 1em; background: #e8a6a6">
                This is black text against the preferred shade of red
            </div>
            <div style="padding: 1em; background: #d8f8d8">
                This is black text against the preferred shade of green
            </div>

                For methodology and metrics see the Jupyter notebook
                <a href="https://github.com/zx-outreach/accessibility/blob/master/colours.ipynb">here</a>.
                Comments from the community are welcome, and should be directed to Hector Miller-Bakewell.
            </p>

            <h2>How to implement in LaTeX</h2>
            <p>
                Simply add the following two snippets of code to your preamble. The first defines the colours "zx_red"
                and "zx_green":
            </p>

            <pre>
\definecolor{zx_red}{RGB}{232, 165, 165}
\definecolor{zx_green}{RGB}{216, 248, 216}
</pre>

            The second defines two node types "gn" and "rn" for use inside tikz diagrams:

            <pre>
\tikzstyle{gn}=[rectangle,rounded corners=0.8em,fill=zx_green,draw=Black,
  line width=0.8 pt,inner sep=3pt,minimum width=1.5em,minimum height=1.5em]
\tikzstyle{rn}=[rectangle,rounded corners=0.8em,fill=zx_red,draw=Black,
  line width=0.8 pt,inner sep=3pt,minimum width=1.5em,minimum height=1.5em]
</pre>

            We also encourage authors to demonstrate which colour is which.
            For example by including a tikz green node and red node immediately after first mentioning the colours:
            <pre>
  The ZX-calculus is built from red [red node] and green [green node] spiders.
</pre>

            <p>
                Note that we encourage rounded rectangles over circles.
                And strongly encourage green Z nodes to be lighter in shade than red X nodes when printed in greyscale.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Alternative colours schemes:
            </h2>
            <p>
                The suggested colours above are by no means the only choice available.
                We require that contrast of black text against the colours is at least 4.5 under all CVD
                transformations, and suggest (but do not require) a lowest Delta-E value of at least 5.
                Here is another colour scheme suggested by the community:
            </p>
            <div style="padding: 1em; background:  #ff8888">
                This is black text against red
            </div>
            <div style="padding: 1em; background:  #ccffcc">
                This is black text against green
            </div>
            <p>
                Which passes the contrast test, but has a lower Delta-E than the suggested colours.
            </p>

            <h2>Livestreaming of workshops</h2>
            There are many reasons that someone may be unable to make it to a workshop in person.
            Here we give some recommendations on how to run a livestream,
            so that these people can still participate in the scientific discourse.

            <h3>
                Setting up a stream
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        There are many livestream providers available that only require setting up an account.
                        These include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a></p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Talks that involve slides can be managed by having the computer showing the slides also join the
                        stream, and using the "share screen" feature.
                        Note that joining nearby computers to the same stream can result in feedback,
                        and microphones / speakers should be muted before doing so.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Talks that involve a speaker and a board can be presented using a webcam; ideally one on a cord
                        that can be repositioned to follow the speaker.
                        An external microphone is also a great help here.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        General discussions can be managed by projecting the stream onto the projector screen, like a
                        slide presentation.
                        Care should be taken that a microphone is positioned so that questions and answers can be heard.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Chairing a stream
            </h3>
            <p>
                There should always be a dedicated person whose task it is to manage the stream.
                This should also be on a rota,
                to spread the load and allow people to focus on the talks they are most interested in.
                The chair's duties include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Ensuring the livestream is still live
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Relaying questions from the stream to the speaker
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Relaying announcements to the stream (e.g. "we are having a break for lunch, and will start
                        again in 75 minutes")
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Note that those on the stream may well be in different timezones,
                so relative timings ("in 15 minutes") are preferred to absolute times ("at 2 o'clock".)
                Notes from previous conferences / livestreams are included in the sections below.

                Notes from running a livestream during the ZX workshop, Grenoble 25-26 February 2019
            </h2>

            <p>The stream:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The livestream was broadcast via the open ZX Google Hangout at
                        https://hangouts.google.com/call/pk4lfcfxx5avtj5jrb36e5e3aue?no_rd
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Anyone with the URL could access the Hangout (as long as they were signed into Google). The URL
                        was distributed on the conference scratch website, and via the ZX mailing list a few days in
                        advance.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        The "workshop account" (in practice the account of the organiser) left the Hangout at breaks and
                        lunchtime, transmitting only during the sessions.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The set-up:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The main broadcasting computer was a 2018 MacBook Pro. Older computers were occasionally used
                        and handled the stream fine. Despite initial worries, there was no problem with the laptop
                        overheating or getting slow.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        An external webcam was plugged into the laptop, and set up on a table in front of where the
                        speakers stood to give their talks. This meant the microphone was close to the speakers, and
                        there was no issue with sound once the settings on the Hangout had been switched to capture
                        sound from the webcam (this did not happen automatically like the video settings did).
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        One person (generally the session chair, which in this case was the organiser) sat to the side
                        at the front, with laptop at right angles to the speaker, at the end of the webcam wire and
                        monitored the livestream for technical issues, checked that the speaker was in frame, and took
                        any questions from the livestream chat. This worked well. The streaming laptop screen wasn't
                        visible to either the speaker or the audience, so did not distract.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>There were three types of session, all with slightly different set-ups.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Talks with slides.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The webcam was pointed at the speaker, who was told where the field of view of the
                                camera was and requested not to wander out of it. Speakers generally took this in their
                                stride (or at least didn't appear visibly to be put off). The speaker's laptop was also
                                connected to the Hangout, and they shared their screen. This meant people on the Hangout
                                could choose to full-screen either the slides or the picture of the speaker.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Dealing with audio feedback was an important issue. The full solutions on each laptop
                                were the following:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Chair's laptop: connected to webcam, video and microphone set to capture from
                                        webcam, speakers on.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Speakers' laptop: connect to projector. Mute speakers before entering the
                                        Hangout. Once in, immediately mute microphone. Share screen (sometimes sharing
                                        only the application caused the Hangout to crash so generally 'share entire
                                        screen' was preferred). Then start slides as usual for a presentation.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Questions: sometimes the livestream could not hear questions from the audience. Asking
                                the speaker to repeat any questions solved that. For questions from the livestream,
                                either the chair read out questions written into the chat, or else livestream attendees
                                unmuted their microphones and asked through the chair's laptop. It worked quite well to
                                turn the laptop around to the speaker, so they could see the video of the person asking
                                the question. There was a direct line of sight between the speaker, the webcam, and the
                                chair+laptop.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Talks on the whiteboard.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Again the webcam was pointed at the speaker. This time, only the webcam image and sound
                                was broadcast. This worked less well than slides talks. Challenges included getting the
                                speaker to write large enough for the livestream to read, and to move the webcam around
                                mid-talk to make sure the speaker and board were always in shot.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                In general, the whiteboard did not come over well on the webcam, and almost all detail
                                was lost.

                                One possible solution in future is to have a second person broadcasting from the
                                speaker's location, who is copying the contents of the whiteboard onto their own laptop
                                (e.g. using a digital pen) and sharing their screen.

                            For these sessions the livestream was projected onto the main screen, and the webcam
                            positioned in front of it pointing at the audience. This enabled two-way communication and
                            involvement of the livestream participants. If auto-switching of the livestream was
                            disabled, someone (e.g. the chair)
                            needed to manually click on whichever livestream person was speaking in order to put them
                            into the main window. This seemed to work well and the audio in both directions enabled
                            reasonably free discussions.

                        Having the livestream increased the participation for minimal cost. It seemed to integrate
                        well, and speaking as the person chiefly responsibly for running it, it required minimal
                        faffing.

                        Next time, I would have a rota of different people monitoring the livestream, not just the same
                        person (me) all the time.

                        It would be good to find a way of giving general announcements in the livestream that people see
                        when they join. E.g "we are running 20 mins behind schedule".

                        Note that people join the livestream in different timezones, so announcements are better as "we
                        will reconvene after lunch in 1 hour" rather than "at 1pm".

                Final comment: <strong>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</strong> that we move to make livestreaming a normal part of
                workshops within the community.
