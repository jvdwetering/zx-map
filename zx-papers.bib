    abstract = {We provide conceptual and mathematical foundations for near-term quantum natural language processing (QNLP), and do so in quantum computer scientist friendly terms. We opted for an expository presentation style, and provide references for supporting empirical evidence and formal statements concerning mathematical generality.   We recall how the quantum model for natural language that we employ canonically combines linguistic meanings with rich linguistic structure, most notably grammar. In particular, the fact that it takes a quantum-like model to combine meaning and structure, establishes QNLP as quantum-native, on par with simulation of quantum systems. Moreover, the now leading Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) paradigm for encoding classical data on quantum hardware, variational quantum circuits, makes NISQ exceptionally QNLP-friendly: linguistic structure can be encoded as a free lunch, in contrast to the apparently exponentially expensive classical encoding of grammar.   Quantum speed-up for QNLP tasks has already been established in previous work with Will Zeng. Here we provide a broader range of tasks which all enjoy the same advantage.   Diagrammatic reasoning is at the heart of QNLP. Firstly, the quantum model interprets language as quantum processes via the diagrammatic formalism of categorical quantum mechanics. Secondly, these diagrams are via ZX-calculus translated into quantum circuits. Parameterisations of meanings then become the circuit variables to be learned.   Our encoding of linguistic structure within quantum circuits also embodies a novel approach for establishing word-meanings that goes beyond the current standards in mainstream AI, by placing linguistic structure at the heart of Wittgenstein's meaning-is-context.}

    abstract = {We provide a graphical treatment of SAT and \#SAT on equal footing. Instances of \#SAT can be represented as tensor networks in a standard way. These tensor networks are interpreted by diagrams of the ZH-calculus: a system to reason about tensors over $\mathbb{C}$ in terms of diagrams built from simple generators, in which computation may be carried out by \emph{transformations of diagrams alone}. In general, nodes of ZH diagrams take parameters over $\mathbb{C}$ which determine the tensor coefficients; for the standard representation of \#SAT instances, the coefficients take the value $0$ or $1$. Then, by choosing the coefficients of a diagram to range over $\mathbb B$, we represent the corresponding instance of SAT. Thus, by interpreting a diagram either over the boolean semiring or the complex numbers, we instantiate either the \emph{decision} or \emph{counting} version of the problem. We find that for classes known to be in P, such as $2$SAT and \#XORSAT, the existence of appropriate rewrite rules allows for efficient simplification of the diagram, producing the solution in polynomial time. In contrast, for classes known to be NP-complete, such as $3$SAT, or \#P-complete, such as \#$2$SAT, the corresponding rewrite rules introduce hyperedges to the diagrams, in numbers which are not easily bounded above by a polynomial. This diagrammatic approach unifies the diagnosis of the complexity of CSPs and \#CSPs and shows promise in aiding tensor network contraction-based algorithms.}

These diagrams represent the underlying mathematical operations and aid physical interpretation, but cannot generally be computed with directly. In this paper we introduce the ZXH-calculus, a graphical language based on the ZX-calculus, that we use to represent and reason about many-body states entirely graphically. As a demonstration, we express the 1D AKLT state, a symmetry protected topological state, in the ZXH-calculus by developing a representation of spins higher than 1/2 within the calculus. By exploiting the simplifying power of the ZXH-calculus rules we show how this representation straightforwardly recovers two important properties, the existence of topologically protected edge states, and the non-vanishing of a string order parameter. We furthermore show how the AKLT matrix-product state representation can be recovered from our diagrams. In addition, we provide an alternative proof that the 2D AKLT state on a hexagonal lattice can be reduced to a graph state, demonstrating that it is a universal quantum computing resource. Our results show that the ZXH-calculus is a powerful language for representing and computing with physical states entirely graphically, paving the way to develop more efficient many-body algorithms.}

    abstract = {Mapping a quantum algorithm to any practical large-scale quantum computer will require a sequence of compilations and optimizations. At the level of fault-tolerant encoding, one likely requirement of this process is the translation into a topological circuit, for which braided circuits represent one candidate model. Given the large overhead associated with encoded circuits, it is paramount to reduce their size in terms of computation time and qubit number through circuit compression. While these optimizations have typically been performed in the language of three-dimensional diagrams, such a representation does not allow an efficient, general, and scalable approach to reduction or verification. We propose the use of the ZX-calculus as an intermediate language for braided circuit compression, demonstrating advantage by comparing results using this approach with those previously obtained for the compression of A- and Y-state distillation circuits. We then provide a benchmark of our method against a small set of Clifford+T circuits, yielding compression percentages of 77%. Our results suggest that the overheads of braided, defect-based circuits are comparable to those of their lattice-surgery counterparts, restoring the potential of this model for surface-code quantum computation.}

The calculus allows us to analyze the structure of qudit stabilizer quantum mechanics and provides a geometrical picture of qudit stabilizer theory using D-toruses, which generalizes the Bloch sphere picture for qubit stabilizer quantum mechanics.
We also use our framework to describe generalizations of Spekkens toy theory to higher dimensional systems. This gives a novel proof that qudit stabilizer quantum mechanics and Spekkens-Schreiber toy theory for dits are operationally equivalent in three dimensions. The qudit pictorial calculus is a useful tool to study quantum foundations, understand the relationship between qubit and qudit quantum mechanics, and provide a novel, high level description of quantum information protocols.}

    abstract = {Quantum entanglement, described by Einstein as "spooky action at a distance", is a key resource in many quantum protocols, like quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. Yet entanglement makes protocols presented in Dirac notation difficult to follow and check. This is why Coecke and Duncan have introduced a diagrammatic language for multi-qubit systems, called the red/green calculus or the ZX-calculus. This diagrammatic notation is both intuitive and formally rigorous. It is a simple, graphical, high level language that emphasises the composition of systems and naturally captures the essentials of quantum mechanics. One crucial feature that will be exploited here is the encoding of complementary observables and corresponding phase shifts. Reasoning is done by rewriting diagrams, i.e. locally replacing some part of a diagram. Diagrams are defined by their topology only; the number of inputs and outputs and the way they are connected. This exemplifies the 'flow' of information. For protocols involving multipartite entangled states, such as the GreenbergerHorne-Zeilinger and W-state, it will be shown that the zx-calculus provides a relatively easy and more intuitive presentation. Moreover, in this representation it is easier to check that protocols are correct. Protocols that will be discussed in detail are quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, leader election, superdense coding and quantum direct communication with multipartite entangled states.}

These rules are used to simplify measurement patterns by reducing the number of qubits while preserving both the semantics and the existence of gflow.

The rewrite rules allow equalities to be derived entirely graphically, leading to the question of completeness: can any equality that is derivable using matrices also be derived graphically? The ZX-calculus is known to be complete for scalar-free pure qubit stabilizer quantum mechanics, meaning any equality between two pure stabilizer operators that is true up to a non-zero scalar factor can be derived using the graphical rewrite rules. Here, we replace those scalar-free rewrite rules with correctly scaled ones and show that, by adding one new diagram element and a new rewrite rule, the calculus can be made complete for pure qubit stabilizer quantum mechanics with scalars. This completeness property allows amplitudes and probabilities to be calculated entirely graphically. We also explicitly consider stabilizer zero diagrams, i.e. diagrams that represent a zero matrix, and show that two new rewrite rules suffice to make the calculus complete for those.}

    abstract = {While quantum theory cannot be described by a local hidden variable model, it is nevertheless possible to construct such models that exhibit features commonly associated with quantum mechanics. These models are also used to explore the question of $\psi$-ontic versus $\psi$-epistemic theories for quantum mechanics. Spekkens’ toy theory is one such model. It arises from classical probabilistic mechanics via a limit on the knowledge an observer may have about the state of a system. The toy theory for the simplest possible underlying system closely resembles stabilizer quantum mechanics, a fragment of quantum theory which is efficiently classically simulable but also non-local. Further analysis of the similarities and differences between those two theories can thus yield new insights into what distinguishes quantum theory from classical theories, and $\psi$-ontic from $\psi$-epistemic theories. In this paper, we develop a graphical language for Spekkens’ toy theory. Graphical languages offer intuitive and rigorous formalisms for the analysis of quantum mechanics and similar theories. To compare quantum mechanics and a toy model, it is useful to have similar formalisms for both. We show that our language fully describes Spekkens’ toy theory and in particular, that it is complete: meaning any equality that can be derived using other formalisms can also be derived entirely graphically. Our language is inspired by a similar graphical language for quantum mechanics called the ZX-calculus. Thus Spekkens’ toy bit theory and stabilizer quantum mechanics can be analysed and compared using analogous graphical formalisms.}

    abstract = {Graphical languages offer intuitive and rigorous formalisms for quantum physics. They can be used to simplify expressions, derive equalities, and do computations. Yet in order to replace conventional formalisms, rigour alone is not sufficient: the new formalisms also need to have equivalent deductive power. This requirement is captured by the property of completeness, which means that any equality that can be derived using some standard formalism can also be derived graphically. In this thesis, I consider the ZX-calculus, a graphical language for pure state qubit quantum mechanics. I show that it is complete for pure state stabilizer quantum mechanics, so any problem within this fragment of quantum theory can be fully analysed using graphical methods. This includes questions of central importance in areas such as error-correcting codes or measurement-based quantum computation. Furthermore, I show that the ZX-calculus is complete for the single-qubit Clifford+T group, which is approximately universal: any single-qubit unitary can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy using only Clifford gates and the T-gate. Lastly, I extend the use of rigorous graphical languages outside quantum theory to Spekkens' toy theory, a local hidden variable model that nevertheless exhibits some features commonly associated with quantum mechanics. I develop a graphical calculus similar to the ZX-calculus that fully describes Spekkens' toy theory, and show that it is complete. Hence, stabilizer quantum mechanics and Spekkens' toy theory can be fully analysed and compared using graphical formalisms. Intuitive graphical languages can replace conventional formalisms for the analysis of many questions in quantum computation and foundations without loss of mathematical rigour or deductive power.}

In the recent years, one of the main achievements of the categorical approach to quantum mechanics has been to provide several equational theories for most of these graphical languages, making them complete for various fragments of pure quantum mechanics. We address the question of the extension of these languages beyond pure quantum mechanics, in order to reason on mixed states and general quantum operations, i.e. completely positive maps. Intuitively, such an extension relies on the axiomatisation of a discard map which allows one to get rid of a quantum system, operation which is not allowed in pure quantum mechanics. We introduce a new construction, the discard construction, which transforms any dagger-symmetric monoidal category into a symmetric monoidal category equipped with a discard map. Roughly speaking this construction consists in making any isometry causal. Using this construction we provide an extension for several graphical languages that we prove to be complete for general quantum operations. However this construction fails for some fringe cases like the Clifford+T quantum mechanics, as the category does not have enough isometries.}

(ii) To axiomatise complementarity of quantum observables within a general framework for physical theories in terms of dagger symmetric monoidal categories. We also axiomatize phase shifts within this framework. 
Using the well-studied canonical correspondence between graphical calculi and symmetric monoidal categories, our results provide a purely graphical formalisation of complementarity for quantum observables. Each individual observable, represented by a commutative special dagger Frobenius algebra, gives rise to an abelian group of phase shifts, which we call the phase group. We also identify a strong form of complementarity, satisfied by the Z and X spin observables, which yields a scaled variant of a bialgebra.}

Using this framework, we establish a tight relationship between two key quantum theoretical notions: non-locality and complementarity. In particular, we establish a direct connection between Mermin-type non-locality scenarios, which we generalise to an arbitrary number of parties, using systems of arbitrary dimension, and performing arbitrary measurements, and a new stronger notion of complementarity which we introduce here. 
Our derivation of the fact that strong complementarity is a necessary condition for a Mermin scenario provides a crisp operational interpretation for strong complementarity. We also provide a complete classification of strongly complementary observables for quantum theory, something which has not yet been achieved for ordinary complementarity. 
Since our main results are expressed in the (diagrammatic) language of dagger-compact categories, they can be applied outside of quantum theory, in any setting which supports the purely algebraic notion of strongly complementary observables. We have therefore introduced a method for discussing non-locality in a wide variety of models in addition to quantum theory. 
The diagrammatic calculus substantially simplifies (and sometimes even trivialises) many of the derivations, and provides new insights. In particular, the diagrammatic computation of correlations clearly shows how local measurements interact to yield a global overall effect. In other words, we depict non-locality.}

We then use this framework to compare two theories: quantum mechanics restricted to qubit stabiliser states and operations, and Spekkens's toy theory. We discover that viewed within our framework these theories are very similar, but differ in one key aspect - a four element group we term the phase group which emerges naturally within our framework. In the case of the stabiliser theory this group is Z4 while for Spekkens's toy theory the group is Z2 x Z2. We further show that the structure of this group is intimately involved in a key physical difference between the theories: whether or not they can be modelled by a local hidden variable theory. This is done by establishing a connection between the phase group, and an abstract notion of GHZ state correlations. We go on to formulate precisely how the stabiliser theory and toy theory are `similar' by defining a notion of `mutually unbiased qubit theory', noting that all such theories have four element phase groups. Since Z4 and Z2 x Z2 are the only such groups we conclude that the GHZ correlations in this type of theory can only take two forms, exactly those appearing in the stabiliser theory and in Spekkens's toy theory. The results point at a classification of local/non-local behaviours by finite Abelian groups, extending beyond qubits to finitary theories whose observables are all mutually unbiased.}

In this paper we expose the algebraic and graphical structure of the GHZ-state and the W-state, as well as a purely graphical distinction that characterises the behaviours of these states. In turn, this structure yields a compositional graphical model for expressing general multipartite states. 
We identify those states, named Frobenius states, which canonically induce an algebraic structure, namely the structure of a commutative Frobenius algebra (CFA). We show that all SLOCC-maximal tripartite qubit states are locally equivalent to Frobenius states. Those that are SLOCC-equivalent to the GHZ-state induce special commutative Frobenius algebras, while those that are SLOCC-equivalent to the W-state induce what we call anti-special commutative Frobenius algebras. From the SLOCC-classification of tripartite qubit states follows a representation theorem for two dimensional CFAs. 
Together, a GHZ and a W Frobenius state form the primitives of a graphical calculus. This calculus is expressive enough to generate and reason about arbitrary multipartite states, which are obtained by "composing" the GHZ- and W-states, giving rise to a rich graphical paradigm for general multipartite entanglement.}

    abstract = {Many physical implementations of quantum computers impose stringent memory constraints in which 2-qubit operations can only be performed between qubits which are nearest neighbours in a lattice or graph structure. Hence, before a computation can be run on such a device, it must be mapped onto the physical architecture. That is, logical qubits must be assigned physical locations in the quantum memory, and the circuit must be replaced by an equivalent one containing only operations between nearest neighbours. In this paper, we give a new technique for quantum circuit mapping (a.k.a. routing), based on Gaussian elimination constrained to certain optimal spanning trees called Steiner trees. We give a reference implementation of the technique for CNOT circuits and show that it significantly out-performs general-purpose routines on CNOT circuits. We then comment on how the technique can be extended straightforwardly to the synthesis of CNOT+Rz circuits and as a modification to a recently-proposed circuit simplification/extraction procedure for generic circuits based on the ZX-calculus. }

In this paper we give the ZX-rules that enable one to derive all equations between 2-qubit Clifford+T quantum circuits. Our rule set is only a small extension of the rules of stabilizer ZX-calculus, and substantially less than those needed for the recently achieved universal completeness. One of our rules is new, and we expect it to also have other utilities. 
These ZX-rules are much simpler than the complete of set Clifford+T circuit equations due to Selinger and Bian, which indicates that ZX-calculus provides a more convenient arena for quantum circuit rewriting than restricting oneself to circuit equations. The reason for this is that ZX-calculus is not constrained by a fixed unitary gate set for performing intermediate computations.}

The arrays of complex numbers are kin to the arrays of 0s and 1s of the early days of computer programming practice. In this review we present steps towards a diagrammatic `high-level' alternative for the Hilbert space formalism, one which appeals to our intuition. It allows for intuitive reasoning about interacting quantum systems, and trivialises many otherwise involved and tedious computations. It clearly exposes limitations such as the no-cloning theorem, and phenomena such as quantum teleportation. As a logic, it supports `automation'. It allows for a wider variety of underlying theories, and can be easily modified, having the potential to provide the required step-stone towards a deeper conceptual understanding of quantum theory, as well as its unification with other physical theories. Specific applications discussed here are purely diagrammatic proofs of several quantum computational schemes, as well as an analysis of the structural origin of quantum non-locality. The underlying mathematical foundation of this high-level diagrammatic formalism relies on so-called monoidal categories, a product of a fairly recent development in mathematics. These monoidal categories do not only provide a natural foundation for physical theories, but also for proof theory, logic, programming languages, biology, cooking, ... The challenge is to discover the necessary additional pieces of structure that allow us to predict genuine quantum phenomena.}

The completeness of the language -- i.e. the ability to derive any true equation -- is a crucial question. In the quest of a complete ZX-calculus, supplementarity has been recently proved to be necessary for quantum diagram reasoning (MFCS 2016). Roughly speaking, supplementarity consists in merging two subdiagrams when they are parameterized by antipodal angles. We introduce a generalised supplementarity -- called cyclotomic supplementarity -- which consists in merging n subdiagrams at once, when the n angles divide the circle into equal parts. We show that when n is an odd prime number, the cyclotomic supplementarity cannot be derived, leading to a countable family of new axioms for diagrammatic quantum reasoning.We exhibit another new simple axiom that cannot be derived from the existing rules of the ZX-Calculus, implying in particular the incompleteness of the language for the so-called Clifford+T quantum mechanics. We end up with a new axiomatisation of an extended ZX-Calculus, including an axiom schema for the cyclotomic supplementarity.}

For many error correcting codes, fault-tolerant realisations of Clifford operations are significantly less resource-intensive than those of T gates, which motivates finding ways to realise the same transformation involving T-count (the number of T gates involved) which is as low as possible. Investigations into this problem [arXiv:1206.0758, 1303.2042, 1308.4134, 1601.07363, 1606.01904, 1701.00140] has led to observations that this problem is closely related to NP-hard tensor decomposition problems [arXiv:1712.01557] and is tantamount to the difficult problem of decoding exponentially long Reed-Muller codes [arXiv:1601.07363]. This problem then presents itself as one for which must be content in practise with approximate optimisation, in which one develops an array of tactics to be deployed through some pragmatic strategy. In this vein, we describe techniques to reduce the T-count, based on the effective application of "spider nest identities": easily recognised products of parity-phase operations which are equivalent to the identity operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such techniques by obtaining improvements in the T-counts of a number of circuits, in run-times which are typically less than the time required to make a fresh cup of coffee. }

Then, using the rules of the ZX-calculus, we give a simplification strategy for ZX-diagrams based on the two graph transformations of local complementation and pivoting and show that the resulting reduced diagram can be transformed back into a quantum circuit. While little is known about extracting circuits from arbitrary ZX-diagrams, we show that the underlying graph of our simplified ZX-diagram always has a graph-theoretic property called generalised flow, which in turn yields a deterministic circuit extraction procedure. For Clifford circuits, this extraction procedure yields a new normal form that is both asymptotically optimal in size and gives a new, smaller upper bound on gate depth for nearest-neighbour architectures. For Clifford+T and more general circuits, our technique enables us to to 'see around' gates that obstruct the Clifford structure and produce smaller circuits than naive 'cut-and-resynthesise' methods.}

The diagrammatic language is generated by two kinds of nodes: the so-called 'spider' associated with the computational basis, as well as a new arity-N generalisation of the Hadamard gate, which satisfies a variation of the spider fusion law. Unlike previous graphical calculi, this admits compact encodings of non-linear classical functions. For example, the AND gate can be depicted as a diagram of just 2 generators, compared to ~25 in the ZX-calculus. Consequently, N-controlled gates, hypergraph states, Hadamard+Toffoli circuits, and diagonal circuits at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy also enjoy encodings with low constant overhead. This suggests that this calculus will be significantly more convenient for reasoning about the interplay between classical non-linear behaviour (e.g. in an oracle) and purely quantum operations. After presenting the calculus, we will prove it is sound and complete for universal quantum computation by demonstrating the reduction of any diagram to an easily describable normal form.}

    abstract = {String diagrams turn algebraic equations into topological moves that have recurring shapes, involving the sliding of one diagram past another. We individuate, at the root of this fact, the dual nature of polygraphs as presentations of higher algebraic theories, and as combinatorial descriptions of "directed spaces". Operations of polygraphs modelled on operations of topological spaces are used as the foundation of a compositional universal algebra, where sliding moves arise from tensor products of polygraphs. We reconstruct several higher algebraic theories in this framework. 
In this regard, the standard formalism of polygraphs has some technical problems. We propose a notion of regular polygraph, barring cell boundaries that are not homeomorphic to a disk of the appropriate dimension. We define a category of non-degenerate shapes, and show how to calculate their tensor products. Then, we introduce a notion of weak unit to recover weakly degenerate boundaries in low dimensions, and prove that the existence of weak units is equivalent to a representability property. 
We then turn to applications of diagrammatic algebra to quantum theory. We re-evaluate the category of Hilbert spaces from the perspective of categorical universal algebra, which leads to a bicategorical refinement. Then, we focus on the axiomatics of fragments of quantum theory, and present the ZW calculus, the first complete diagrammatic axiomatisation of the theory of qubits. 
The ZW calculus has several advantages over ZX calculi, including a computationally meaningful normal form, and a fragment whose diagrams can be read as setups of fermionic oscillators. Moreover, its generators reflect an operational classification of entangled states of 3 qubits. We conclude with generalisations of the ZW calculus to higher-dimensional systems, including the definition of a universal set of generators in each dimension.}

In this framework, two equational diagrammatic calculi have been proposed for pure-state qubit quantum computing: the ZW calculus, developed by Coecke, Kissinger and the first author for the purpose of qubit entanglement classification, and the ZX calculus, introduced by Coecke and Duncan to give an abstract description of complementary observables. Neither calculus, however, provided a complete axiomatisation of their model.

In this paper, we present extended versions of ZW and ZX, and show their completeness for pure-state qubit theory, thus solving two major open problems in categorical quantum mechanics. First, we extend the original ZW calculus to represent states and linear maps with coefficients in an arbitrary commutative ring, and prove completeness by a strategy that rewrites all diagrams into a normal form. We then extend the language and axioms of the original ZX calculus, and show their completeness for pure-state qubit theory through a translation between ZX and ZW specialised to the field of complex numbers. This translation expands the one used by Jeandel, Perdrix, and Vilmart to derive an axiomatisation of the approximately universal Clifford+T fragment; restricting the field of complex numbers to a suitable subring, we obtain an alternative axiomatisation of the same theory.}

We present here results that show that equations between separable infinite families of diagrams are finitely verifiable; that is to say that to verify these infinite families of equations it suffices to check a finite subset of that family, provided a condition we call separability is met. The results we present in this paper not only construct such a verifying subfamily directly, but also generalise to any diagrammatic calculus that satisfies certain simple conditions.}

    abstract = {While multipartite entanglement is a crucial resource for many quantum algorithms and protocols, the abstract, structural rules governing it are still not fully understood. In their recent paper, Coecke and Kissinger propose a new language called GHZ/W-calculus that aims to give a structural axiomatization of multipartite entanglement in terms of interacting ``special'' and ``anti-special'' commutative Frobenius algebras (S/A-CFAs). These algebraic structures correspond precisely to the two different types of genuine entanglement between three qubits, as given by inter-convertability by stochastic local (quantum) operations and classical communication (SLOCC). An important feature of the language is that it lives in the framework of categorical quantum mechanics and thus comes with a Penrose-Joyal-Street graphical calulus. This thesis explores the expressive power of the GHZ/W-calculus. We prove a new result that demonstrates the canonicity of the recent concept of antispeciality for CFAs and use it to give a new classification of Frobenius Algebras on $\mathbb{C}^2$ in FdHilb, the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps. Next, we look at the non-standard model of categorical quantum mechanics given by FRel, the category of finite sets and binary relations. We classify all special CFAs in this category, prove some properties of anti-special ones and identify precisely which SCFAs/ACFAs are captured by the GHZ/W-language. Finally, we define a quantum AND gate in the graphical language and prove (or disprove) some of its properties. We come to the conclusion that the GHZ/W-calculus is unlikely to be the final answer to the structural entanglement problem in dimensions $D > 2$ and identify intermediate ranks $1 < rank < D$ as the notion it fails to explain.}

In this paper we apply the category-theoretic work of Abramsky and Coecke to the topological cluster-state model of quantum computing to give a high-level graphical language that enables direct translation between quantum processes and physical patterns of measurement in a computer - a "compiler language". We give the equivalence between the graphical and topological information flows, and show the applicable rewrite algebra for this computing model.

Functional quantum devices will require the ability to correct error in order to be scalable and effective. A leading choice of error correction, in particular for modular or distributed architectures, is the surface code with logical two-qubit operations realised via "lattice surgery". These operations consist of "merges" and "splits" acting non-unitarily on the logical states and are not easily captured by standard circuit notation. This raises the question of how best to reason about lattice surgery in order efficiently to use quantum states and operations in architectures with complex resource management issues. In this paper we demonstrate that the operations of the ZX calculus, a form of quantum diagrammatic reasoning designed using category theory, match exactly the operations of lattice surgery. Red and green "spider" nodes match rough and smooth merges and splits, and follow the axioms of a dagger special associative Frobenius algebra. Some lattice surgery operations can require non-trivial correction operations, which are captured natively in the use of the ZX calculus in the form of ensembles of diagrams. We give a first taste of the power of the calculus as a language for surgery by considering two operations (magic state use and producing a CNOT) and show how ZX diagram re-write rules give lattice surgery procedures for these operations that are novel, efficient, and highly configurable.}

Thanks to a system of back-and-forth translation between the ZX-Calculus and a third-party complete graphical language, we prove that the provided axiomatisation is complete for the first approximately universal fragment of the language, namely Clifford+T. We then prove that the expressive power of this presentation, though aimed at achieving completeness for the aforementioned restriction, extends beyond Clifford+T, to a class of diagrams that we call linear with Clifford+T constants. We use another version of the third-party language - and an adapted system of back-and-forth translation - to complete the language for the ZX-Calculus as a whole, that is, with no restriction. We briefly discuss the added axioms, and finally, we provide a complete axiomatisation for an altered version of the language which involves an additional generator, making the presentation simpler.}

    abstract = {We introduce here a new axiomatisation of the rational fragment of the ZX-calculus, a diagrammatic language for quantum mechanics. Compared to the previous axiomatisation introduced in [8], our axiomatisation does not use any metarule , but relies instead on a more natural rule, called the cyclotomic supplementarity rule, that was introduced previously in the literature. Our axiomatisation is only complete for diagrams using rational angles , and is not complete in the general case. Using results on diophantine geometry, we characterize precisely which diagram equality involving arbitrary angles are provable in our framework without any new axioms, and we show that our axiomatisation is continuous, in the sense that a diagram equality involving arbitrary angles is provable iff it is a limit of diagram equalities involving rational angles. We use this result to give a complete characterization of all Euler equations that are provable in this axiomatisation.}

An axiomatisation has recently been proven to be complete for an approximatively universal fragment of quantum mechanics, the so-called Clifford+T fragment. We focus here on the expressive power of this axiomatisation beyond Clifford+T Quantum mechanics. We consider the full pure qubit quantum mechanics, and mainly prove two results: (i) First, the axiomatisation for Clifford+T quantum mechanics is also complete for all equations involving some kind of linear diagrams. The linearity of the diagrams reflects the phase group structure, an essential feature of the ZX-calculus. In particular all the axioms of the ZX-calculus are involving linear diagrams. (ii) We also show that the axiomatisation for Clifford+T is not complete in general but can be completed by adding a single (non linear) axiom, providing a simpler axiomatisation of the ZX-calculus for pure quantum mechanics than the one recently introduced by Ng&Wang.}

The resource states which play the role of graph states are prepared via 2-qubit gates of the form $\exp(−i\pi 2nZ\otimes Z)$. When $n=2$, these are equivalent, up to local Clifford unitaries, to graph states. However, when $n>2$, their behaviour diverges in two important ways. First, multiple applications of the entangling gate to a single pair of qubits produces non-trivial entanglement, and hence multiple parallel edges between nodes play an important role in these generalised graph states. Second, such a state can be used to realise deterministic, approximately universal computation using only Pauli Z and X measurements and feed-forward. Even though, for $n>2$, the relevant resource states are no longer stabiliser states, they admit a straightforward, graphical representation using the ZX-calculus. Using this representation, we are able to provide a simple, graphical proof of universality. We furthermore show that for every $n>2$ this family is capable of producing all Clifford gates and all diagonal gates in the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy.}

We present a new method for reducing the number of T-gates in a quantum circuit based on the ZX-calculus, which matches or beats previous approaches to T-count reduction on the majority of our benchmark circuits in the ancilla-free case, in some cases yielding up to 50\% improvement. Our method begins by representing the quantum circuit as a ZX-diagram, a tensor network-like structure that can be transformed and simplified according to the rules of the ZX-calculus. We then show that a recently-proposed simplification strategy can be extended to reduce T-count using a new technique called phase teleportation. This technique allows non-Clifford phases to combine and cancel by propagating non-locally through a generic quantum circuit. Phase teleportation does not change the number or location of non-phase gates and the method also applies to arbitrary non-Clifford phase gates as well as gates with unknown phase parameters in parametrised circuits. Furthermore, the simplification strategy we use is powerful enough to validate equality of many circuits. In particular, we use it to show that our optimised circuits are indeed equal to the original ones. We have implemented the routines of this paper in the open-source library PyZX.}

For the |CCZ⟩ factory we apply the surface code lattice surgery construction techniques described by Fowler et al. to the fault-tolerant Toffoli. The resulting factory has a footprint of $12d\times 6d$ (where $d$ is the code distance) and produces one |CCZ⟩ every 5.5d surface code cycles. Our |T⟩ state factory uses the |CCZ⟩ factory's output and a catalyst |T⟩ state to exactly transform one |CCZ⟩ state into two |T⟩ states. It has a footprint $25\%$ smaller than the factory of Fowler et al. but outputs |T⟩ states twice as quickly. We show how to generalize the catalyzed transformation to arbitrary phase angles, and note that the case $θ=22.5^a$ produces a particularly efficient circuit for producing |$\sqrt{T}$⟩ states. Compared to using the $12d\times 8d\times 6.5d$ |T⟩ factory of Fowler et al., our |CCZ⟩ factory can quintuple the speed of algorithms that are dominated by the cost of applying Toffoli gates, including Shor's algorithm and the chemistry algorithm of Babbush et al.. Assuming a physical gate error rate of $10^{−3}$, our CCZ factory can produce $∼10^{10}$ states on average before an error occurs. This is sufficient for classically intractable instantiations of the chemistry algorithm, but for more demanding algorithms such as Shor's algorithm the mean number of states until failure can be increased to $∼10^{12}$ by increasing the factory footprint $~20\%$.}

The best known of these is the ZX-calculus, which is an industry candidate for an Intermediate Representation; a language that sits between the algorithm designer's intent and the quantum hardware's gate instructions. The ZX calculus, built from generalised Z and X rotations, has difficulty reasoning about arbitrary rotations. This contrasts with the cross-hardware compiler TriQ which uses these arbitrary rotations to exploit hardware efficiencies. In this paper we introduce the graphical calculus ZQ, which uses quaternions to represent these arbitrary rotations, similar to TriQ, and the phase-free Z spider to represent entanglement, similar to ZX. We show that this calculus is sound and complete for qubit quantum computing, while also showing that a fully spider-based representation would have been impossible. This new calculus extends the zoo of qubit graphical calculi, each with different strengths, and we hope it will provide a common language for the optimisation procedures of both ZX and TriQ.}

In contrast to the first complete axiomatisation of the ZX-calculus for the Clifford+T fragment, we have two new generators as features rather than novelties: the triangle can be employed as an essential component to construct a Toffoli gate in a very simple form, while the lambda box can be slightly extended to a generalised phase so that the generalised supplementarity (cyclotomic supplementarity ) is naturally seen as a special case of the generalised spider rule.}

We present a modified rule-set for the phase-free ZH-calculus and show that it is complete. We further discuss the minimality of this rule-set and we give an intuitive interpretation of the rules.

The gate most commonly considered for this purpose is the T=diag(1,exp(i\pi/4)) gate. As T gates are computationally expensive to perform fault-tolerantly in the most promising error-correction technologies, minimising the "T-count" (the number of T gates) required to realise a given unitary in a Clifford+T circuit is of great interest. We describe techniques to find circuits with reduced T-count in unitary circuits, which develop on the ideas of Heyfron and Campbell [arXiv:1712.01557] with the help of the ZX calculus. Following [arXiv:1712.01557], we reduce the problem to that of minimising the T count of a CNOT+T circuit. The ZX calculus motivates a further reduction to simplifying a product of commuting "\pi/4-parity-phase" operations: diagonal unitary transformations which induce a relative phase of exp(i\pi/4) depending on the outcome of a parity computation on the standard basis (which motivated Kissinger and van de Wetering [1903.10477] to introduce "phase gadgets"). For a number of standard benchmark circuits, we show that these techniques --- in some cases supplemented by the TODD subroutine of Heyfron and Campbell [arXiv:1712.01557] --- yield T-counts comparable to or better than the best previously known results.}

In this paper, we extend its power by generalising ZX-calculus to such an extent that it both in an arbitrary commutative ring and an arbitrary commutative semiring. We follow the framework of arXiv:2007.13739 to prove that the proposed ZX-calculus over an arbitrary commutative ring is complete for matrices over the same ring, via a normal form inspired from matrix elementary operations such as row addition and row multiplication. This work paves the way for doing elementary number theory in string diagrams. The proof of completeness for ZX-calculus over arbitrary commutative semirings is quite similar, whose details will be provided in a forthcoming version.}

The compositional structure of this calculus was shown to be well‐equipped to sufficiently express arbitrary mutlipartite quantum states equivalent under stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC). However, it is still not clear how to explicitly identify which graphical properties lead to what states. This can be achieved if we have well‐behaved normal forms for arbitrary graphs within this calculus. This article lays down a first attempt at realizing such normal forms for a restricted class of such graphs, namely simple and regular graphs. These results should pave the way for the most general cases as part of future work.}

We prove that its $\pi/4$-fragment is not complete, in other words the ZX-calculus is not complete for the so called "Clifford+T quantum mechanics". The completeness of this fragment was one of the main open problems in categorical quantum mechanics, a programme initiated by Abramsky and Coecke. The ZX-calculus was known to be incomplete for quantum mechanics. On the other hand, its $\pi/2$-fragment is known to be complete, i.e. the ZX-calculus is complete for the so called "stabilizer quantum mechanics". Deciding whether its $\pi/4$-fragment is complete is a crucial step in the development of the ZX-calculus since this fragment is approximately universal for quantum mechanics, contrary to the $\pi/2$-fragment. To establish our incompleteness result, we consider a fairly simple property of quantum states called supplementarity. We show that supplementarity can be derived in the ZX-calculus if and only if the angles involved in this equation are multiples of $\pi/2$. In particular, the impossibility to derive supplementarity for $\pi/4$ implies the incompleteness of the ZX-calculus for Clifford+T quantum mechanics. As a consequence, we propose to add the supplementarity to the set of rules of the ZX-calculus. We also show that if a ZX-diagram involves antiphase twins, they can be merged when the ZX-calculus is augmented with the supplementarity rule. Merging antiphase twins makes diagrammatic reasoning much easier and provides a purely graphical meaning to the supplementarity rule.}

String diagrams are used to represent a collection of processes, depicted as "boxes" with multiple (typed) inputs and outputs, depicted as "wires". If we allow plugging input and output wires together, we can intuitively represent complex compositions of processes, formalised as morphisms in a monoidal category.   [...] The first major contribution of this dissertation is the introduction of a discretised version of a string diagram called a string graph. String graphs form a partial adhesive category, so they can be manipulated using double-pushout graph rewriting. Furthermore, we show how string graphs modulo a rewrite system can be used to construct free symmetric traced and compact closed categories on a monoidal signature.   
    The second contribution is in the application of graphical languages to quantum information theory. We use a mixture of diagrammatic and algebraic techniques to prove a new classification result for strongly complementary observables. [...] We also introduce a graphical language for multipartite entanglement and illustrate a simple graphical axiom that distinguishes the two maximally-entangled tripartite qubit states: GHZ and W. [...]   
    The third contribution is a description of two software tools developed in part by the author to implement much of the theoretical content described here.

In particular, the analysis of alternative sets of theories which exhibit similar structural features as quantum theory has yielded important new results and physical understanding. An important task is to undertake a thorough analysis and classification of quantum-like theories. In this thesis, we take a step in this direction, moving towards a synthetic description of alternative theories in quantum foundations. After a brief philosophical introduction, we give a presentation of the mathematical concepts underpinning the foundations of physics, followed by an introduction to the foundations of quantum mechanics. The core of the thesis consists of three results chapters based on the articles in the author’s publications page. Chapter 4 analyses the logic of stabilizer quantum mechanics and provides a complete set of circuit equations for this sub-theory of quantum mechanics. Chapter 5 describes how quantum-like theories can be classified in a periodic table of theories. A pictorial calculus for alternative physical theories, called the ZX calculus for qudits, is then introduced and used as a tool to depict particular examples of quantum-like theories, including qudit stabilizer quantum mechanics and the SpekkensSchreiber toy theory. Chapter 6 presents an alternative set of quantum-like theories, called quantum collapse models. A novel quantum collapse model, where the rate of collapse depends on the Quantum Integrated Information of a physical system, is introduced and discussed in some detail. We then conclude with a brief summary of the main results.}

Completeness of the ZX-calculus means any equality of matrices with size powers of $n$ can be derived purely diagrammatically. In this thesis, we give the first complete axiomatisation the ZX-calculus for the overall pure qubit quantum mechanics, via a translation from the completeness result of another graphical language for quantum computing -- the ZW-calculus. This paves the way for automated pictorial quantum computing, with the aid of some software like Quantomatic.

Based on this universal completeness, we directly obtain a complete axiomatisation of the ZX-calculus for the Clifford+T quantum mechanics, which is approximatively universal for quantum computing, by restricting the ring of complex numbers to its subring corresponding to the Clifford+T fragment resting on the completeness theorem of the ZW-calculus for arbitrary commutative ring.

Furthermore, we prove the completeness of the ZX-calculus (with just 9 rules) for 2-qubit Clifford+T circuits by verifying the complete set of 17 circuit relations in diagrammatic rewriting. This is an important step towards efficient simplification of general n-qubit Clifford+T circuits, considering that we now have all the necessary rules for diagrammatical quantum reasoning and a very simple construction of Toffoli gate within our axiomatisation framework, which is approximately universal for quantum computation together with the Hadamard gate.

In addition to completeness results within the qubit related formalism, we extend the completeness of the ZX-calculus for qubit stabilizer quantum mechanics to the qutrit stabilizer system.

Finally, we show with some examples the application of the ZX-calculus to the proof of generalised supplementarity, the representation of entanglement classification and Toffoli gate, as well as equivalence-checking for the UMA gate.}

However, because of this, it is kind of restricting. It will be desirable to have a higher level language which provides further abstraction. This is where ZX and ZW calculus comes in. These two calculi are diagrammatic abstraction of quantum operations, similar to quantum circuits, but is more liberal than the circuit formalism.
Abstraction may be good, but it is, after all, not the actual thing; there are
limitations to how much the abstraction can reason about the systems. This is the
concept of completeness. If an abstraction can capture all of the system’s dynamics, then we say that it is complete. The circuit formalism and the ZX calculus are known to be incomplete, and it greatly limits their ability to reason quantum operations. This thesis is about completeness, but we won’t explore the completeness of the quantum circuit formalism; we will present a ZX calculus that is complete. The ZW calculus is complete, but it is hard to make connections to the implementable quantum operations. We could modify the calculus to obtain a calculus that is closely related to what is called fermionic circuits, but then this calculus is not known to be complete. In this thesis, we will complete it. As a bonus, we will show an even more restricted version, that may have connections to the understanding of the universe, which is complete. This may be an useful abstraction for the study of the fundamental properties of fermions.
The gist of the thesis is not about the complete ZW and ZX calculi; it is the
formula to produce a complete diagrammatic calculus.}

Quantum evolutions are seen in this formalism as open graphs, or diagrams, that can be transformed locally according to a set of axioms that preserve the result of the computation. One of the most important aspects of language is its completeness: Given two diagrams that represent the same quantum evolution, can I transform one into the other using only the graphical rules allowed by the language? If this is the case, it means that the graphical language captures quantum mechanics entirely. The language is known to be complete for a particular subclass (or fragment) of quantum evolutions, called Clifford. Unfortunately, this one is not universal: we cannot represent, or even approach, certain quantum evolutions. In this thesis, we propose to extend the set of axioms to obtain completeness for larger fragments of the language, which in particular are approximately universal, or even universal. To do this, we first use the completeness of another graphical language and transport this result to the ZX-Calculus. In order to simplify this tedious step, we introduce an intermediate language, interesting in itself as it captures a particular but universal fragment of quantum mechanics: Toffoli-Hadamard. We then define the notion of a linear diagram, which provides a uniform proof for some sets of equations. We also define the notion of singular value decomposition of a diagram, which allows us to avoid a large number of calculations. In a second step, we define a normal form that exists for an infinite number of...}

The initial aim for this was Conjecture Synthesis; the algorithmic process of creating theorems. To this process we introduce a generalisation step, which itself requires the ability to infer and then verify parameterised families of theorems. This thesis introduces such inference and verification frameworks, in doing so forging novel links between graphical calculi and fields such as Algebraic Geometry and Galois Theory. These frameworks inspired further research into the design of graphical calculi, and we introduce two important new calculi here. First is the calculus RING, which is initial among ring-based qubit graphical calculi, and in turn inspired the introduction and classification of phase homomorphism pairs also presented here. The second is the calculus ZQ, an edge-decorated calculus which naturally expresses arbitrary qubit rotations, eliminating the need for non-linear rules such as (EU) of ZX. It is expected that these results will be of use to those creating optimisation schemes and intermediate representations for quantum computing, to those creating new graphical calculi, and for those performing conjecture synthesis.}

A translation to some extension of TOF, as opposed to some fragment of the ZX-calculus, is a natural choice because of the multiplicative nature of the Toffoli gate. To this end, we show that freely adding counits to the semi-Frobenius algebra of a discrete inverse category is the same as computing the "environment structure" of the classical structures of the base discrete inverse category. We show that in this setting, the classical channels and the discrete Cartesian completion are the same constructions. Therefore, in the case of TOF, freely adding a counit, constructing the category of quantum channels, and computing the discrete Cartesian completion are all equivalent to partial functions between powers of the two element set. By glueing together the free counit completion and the free unit completion, this yields the strictification of spans between powers of the two element set. }

Two families of nodes of these networks are ones which commute with either Z rotations or X rotations, usually called "green nodes" and "red nodes" respectively. The original formulation of the ZX calculus was motivated in part by properties of the algebras formed by the green and red nodes: notably, that they form a bialgebra -- but only up to scalar factors. As a consequence, the diagram transformations and notation for certain unitary operations involve "scalar gadgets" which denote contributions to a normalising factor. We present renormalised generators for the ZX calculus, which form a bialgebra precisely. As a result, no scalar gadgets are required to represent the most common unitary transformations, and the corresponding diagram transformations are generally simpler. We also present a similar renormalised version of the ZH calculus. We obtain these results by an analysis of conditions under which various "idealised" rewrites are sound, leveraging the existing presentations of the ZX and ZH calculi.}

On the contrary, we assume consciousness to be fundamental, and that one of the main features of consciousness is characterized as being other-dependent. We set up a framework which naturally subsumes this feature by defining a compact closed category where morphisms represent conscious processes. These morphisms are a composition of a set of generators, each being specified by their relations with other generators, and therefore co-dependent. The framework is general enough and fits well into a compositional model of consciousness. Interestingly, we also show how our proposal may become a step towards avoiding the hard problem of consciousness, and thereby address the combination problem of conscious experiences.}

After briefly summarizing the relevant formalisms, and presenting a categorical formulation of the Wolfram model in terms of adhesive categories and double-pushout rewriting systems, we illustrate how the diagrammatic rewritings of the ZX-calculus can be embedded and realized within the broader context of Wolfram model multiway systems, and illustrate some of the capabilities of the software framework (ZXMultiwaySystem) that we have developed specifically for this purpose. Finally, we present a proof (along with an explicitly computed example) based on the methods of Dixon and Kissinger that the multiway evolution graphs and branchial graphs of the Wolfram model are naturally endowed with a monoidal structure based on rulial composition that is, furthermore, compatible with the monoidal product of ZX-diagrams.}

We show that the two leading models for quantum theory with closed timelike curves---namely the P-CTC model of Lloyd et al. and the D-CTC model of Deutsch---are captured by our framework, and in doing so we provide the first compositional description of the D-CTC model. Our description of the D-CTC model results in a process theory which respects the constraints of relativistic causality: this is in direct contrast to the P-CTC model, where CTCs are implemented by a trace and allow post-selection to be performed deterministically.}

The past 50 years have seen a number of non-locality proofs, but its fundamental building blocks, and the exact role it plays in quantum protocols, has remained elusive. In this paper, we focus on a particular flavour of non-locality, generalising Mermin's argument on the GHZ state. Using strongly complementary observables, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for Mermin non-locality in abstract process theories. We show that the existence of more phases than classical points (aka eigenstates) is not sufficient, and that the key to Mermin non-locality lies in the presence of certain algebraically non-trivial phases. This allows us to show that fRel, a favourite toy model for categorical quantum mechanics, is Mermin local. We show Mermin non-locality to be the key resource ensuring the device-independent security of the HBB CQ (N,N) family of Quantum Secret Sharing protocols. Finally, we challenge the unspoken assumption that the measurements involved in Mermin-type scenarios should be complementary (like the pair X,Y), opening the doors to a much wider class of potential experimental setups than currently employed. In short, we give conditions for Mermin non-locality tests on any number of systems, where each party has an arbitrary number of measurement choices, where each measurement has an arbitrary number of outcomes and further, that works in any abstract process theory.}

Yet in order to replace conventional formalisms, rigour alone is not sufficient: the new formalisms also need to have equivalent deductive power. This requirement is captured by the property of completeness, which means that any equality that can be derived using some standard formalism can also be derived graphically. In this thesis, I consider the ZX-calculus, a graphical language for pure state qubit quantum mechanics. I show that it is complete for pure state stabilizer quantum mechanics, so any problem within this fragment of quantum theory can be fully analysed using graphical methods. This includes questions of central importance in areas such as error-correcting codes or measurement-based quantum computation. Furthermore, I show that the ZX-calculus is complete for the single-qubit Clifford+T group, which is approximately universal: any single-qubit unitary can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy using only Clifford gates and the T-gate. Lastly, I extend the use of rigorous graphical languages outside quantum theory to Spekkens' toy theory, a local hidden variable model that nevertheless exhibits some features commonly associated with quantum mechanics. I develop a graphical calculus similar to the ZX-calculus that fully describes Spekkens' toy theory, and show that it is complete. Hence, stabilizer quantum mechanics and Spekkens' toy theory can be fully analysed and compared using graphical formalisms. Intuitive graphical languages can replace conventional formalisms for the analysis of many questions in quantum computation and foundations without loss of mathematical rigour or deductive power.}

    abstract = {There are various gate sets that can be used to describe a quantum computation. A particularly popular gate set in the literature on quantum computing consists of arbitrary single-qubit gates and 2-qubit CNOT gates. A CNOT gate is however not always the natural multi-qubit interaction that can be implemented on a given physical quantum computer, necessitating a compilation step that transforms these CNOT gates to the native gate set. A particularly interesting case where compilation is necessary is for ion trap quantum computers, where the natural entangling operation can act on more than 2 qubits and can even act globally on all qubits at once. This calls for an entirely different approach to constructing efficient circuits. In this paper we study the problem of converting a given circuit that uses 2-qubit gates to one that uses global gates. Our three main contributions are as follows. First, we find an efficient algorithm for transforming an arbitrary circuit consisting of Clifford gates and arbitrary phase gates into a circuit consisting of single-qubit gates and a number of global interactions proportional to the number of non-Clifford phases present in the original circuit. Second, we find a general strategy to transform a global gate that targets all qubits into one that targets only a subset of the qubits. This approach scales linearly with the number of qubits that are not targeted, in contrast to the exponential scaling reported in (Maslov & Nam, N. J. Phys. 2018). Third, we improve on the number of global gates required to synthesise an arbitrary n-qubit Clifford circuit from the 12n-18 reported in (Maslov & Nam, N. J. Phys. 2018) to 6n-8.}

We previously showed that the stabilizer ZX-calculus can be simplified by reducing the number of rewrite rules, without losing the property of completeness [Backens, Perdrix & Wang, EPTCS 236:1--20, 2017]. Here, we show that most of the remaining rules of the language are indeed necessary. We do however leave as an open question the necessity of two rules. These include, surprisingly, the bialgebra rule, which is an axiomatisation of complementarity, the cornerstone of the ZX-calculus. Furthermore, we show that a weaker ambient category -- a braided autonomous category instead of the usual compact closed category -- is sufficient to recover the meta rule 'only connectivity matters', even without assuming any symmetries of the generators.}

Because these fragments of the ZX-calculus have semantics in terms of full subcategories of categories of spans, they can not be presented by distributive laws over groupoids. Instead, we first construct their subcategories of partial isomorphisms via distributive laws over all isomorphims with subobjects adoined. After which, the full subcategory of spans are obtained by freely adjoining units and counits the the semi-Frobenius structures given by the diagonal and codiagonal maps.}

    abstract = {Graphical languages, like quantum circuits or ZX-calculus, have been successfully designed to represent (memoryless) quantum computations acting on a finite number of qubits. Meanwhile, delayed traces have been used as a graphical way to represent finite-memory computations on streams, in a classical setting (cartesian data types). We merge those two approaches and describe a general construction that extends any graphical language, equipped with a notion of discarding, to a graphical language of finite memory computations. In order to handle cases like the ZX-calculus, which is complete for post-selected quantum mechanics, we extend the delayed trace formalism beyond the causal case, refining the notion of causality for stream transformers. We design a stream semantics based on stateful morphism sequences and, under some assumptions, show universality and completeness results. Finally, we investigate the links of our framework with previous works on cartesian data types, signal flow graphs, and quantum channels with memories.}

Central to that approach was the use of pictures and pictorial transformation rules to understand and derive features of quantum theory and computation. However, this approach left many wondering `where's the beef?' In other words, was this new approach capable of producing new results, or was it simply an aesthetically pleasing way to restate stuff we already know?   The aim of this sequel paper is to say `here's the beef!', and highlight some of the major results of the approach advocated in Kindergarten Quantum Mechanics, and how they are being applied to tackle practical problems on real quantum computers. We will focus mainly on what has become the Swiss army knife of the pictorial formalism: the ZX-calculus. First we look at some of the ideas behind the ZX-calculus, comparing and contrasting it with the usual quantum circuit formalism. We then survey results from the past 2 years falling into three categories: (1) completeness of the rules of the ZX-calculus, (2) state-of-the-art quantum circuit optimisation results in commercial and open-source quantum compilers relying on ZX, and (3) the use of ZX in translating real-world stuff like natural language into quantum circuits that can be run on today's (very limited) quantum hardware.   We also take the title literally, and outline an ongoing experiment aiming to show that ZX-calculus enables children to do cutting-edge quantum computing stuff. If anything, this would truly confirm that `kindergarten quantum mechanics' wasn't just a joke.}

Computations in this gate set can be elegantly described by the ZX-calculus, a graphical language for a class of string diagrams describing linear maps between qubits. The ZX-calculus has proven useful in a variety of areas of quantum information, but is less suitable for reasoning about operations outside its natural gate set such as multi-linear Boolean operations like the Toffoli gate. In this paper we study the ZH-calculus, an alternative graphical language of string diagrams that does allow straightforward encoding of Toffoli gates and other more complicated Boolean logic circuits. We find a set of simple rewrite rules for this calculus and show it is complete with respect to matrices over $\mathbb{Z}[\frac12]$, which correspond to the approximately universal Toffoli+Hadamard gateset. Furthermore, we construct an extended version of the ZH-calculus that is complete with respect to matrices over any ring $R$ where $1+1$ is not a zero-divisor.}

However, there are families of such problems which are known to be in P when the dimension is below a certain value. By expressing problem instances from these families as ZX-diagrams, we see that the easy instances belong to the stabilizer fragment of the ZX-calculus. Building on previous work on efficient simplification of qubit stabilizer diagrams, we present simplifying rewrites for the case of qutrits, which are of independent interest in the field of quantum circuit optimisation. Finally, we look at the specific examples of evaluating the Jones polynomial and of counting graph-colourings. Our exposition further champions the ZX-calculus as a suitable and unifying language for studying the complexity of a broad range of classical and quantum problems.}

Applying this to ZX diagrams, we show how to calculate diagrammatically the gradient of a linear map with respect to a phase parameter. For diagrams of parametrised quantum circuits, we get the well-known parameter-shift rule at the basis of many variational quantum algorithms. We then extend our method to the automatic differentation of hybrid classical-quantum circuits, using diagrams with bubbles to encode arbitrary non-linear operators. Moreover, diagrammatic differentiation comes with an open-source implementation in DisCoPy, the Python library for monoidal categories. Diagrammatic gradients of classical-quantum circuits can then be simplified using the PyZX library and executed on quantum hardware via the tket compiler. This opens the door to many practical applications harnessing both the structure of string diagrams and the computational power of quantum machine learning.}

Within this model, the grammatical reduction of a sentence is interpreted as a diagram, encoding a specific interaction of words according to the grammar. It is this interaction which, together with a specific choice of word embedding, realises the meaning (or "semantics") of a sentence. Building on the formal quantum-like nature of such interactions, we present a method for mapping DisCoCat diagrams to quantum circuits. Our methodology is compatible both with NISQ devices and with established Quantum Machine Learning techniques, paving the way to near-term applications of quantum technology to natural language processing.}

We focus especially upon the application of this new algorithm to the problem of automated circuit simplification in quantum information theory, using Wolfram model multiway operator systems combined with the ZX-calculus formalism for enacting fast diagrammatic reasoning over linear transformations between qubits. We show how to construct a generalization of the deductive inference rules for Knuth-Bendix completion in which equation matches are selected on the basis of causal edge density in the associated multiway system, before proceeding to demonstrate how to embed the higher-order logic of the ZX-calculus rules within this first-order equational framework. After showing explicitly how the (hyper)graph rewritings of both Wolfram model systems and the ZX-calculus can be effectively realized within this formalism, we proceed to exhibit comparisons of time complexity vs. proof complexity for this new algorithmic approach when simplifying randomly-generated Clifford circuits down to pseudo-normal form, as well as when reducing the number of T-gates in randomly-generated non-Clifford circuits, with circuit sizes ranging up to 3000 gates, illustrating that the method performs favorably in comparison with existing circuit simplification frameworks, and also exhibiting the approximately quadratic speedup obtained by employing the causal edge density optimization. Finally, we present a worked example of an automated proof of correctness for a simple quantum teleportation protocol, in order to demonstrate more clearly the internal operations of the theorem-proving procedure.}

  abstract = {Symplectic vector spaces are the phase space of linear mechanical systems. The symplectic form describes, for example, the relation between position and momentum as well as current and voltage. The category of linear Lagrangian relations between symplectic vector spaces is a symmetric monoidal subcategory of relations which gives a semantics for the evolution -- and more generally linear constraints on the evolution -- of various physical systems.   We give a new presentation of the category of Lagrangian relations over an arbitrary field as a `doubled' category of linear relations. More precisely, we show that it arises as a variation of Selinger's CPM construction applied to linear relations, where the covariant orthogonal complement functor plays of the role of conjugation. Furthermore, for linear relations over prime fields, this corresponds exactly to the CPM construction for a suitable choice of dagger. We can furthermore extend this construction by a single affine shift operator to obtain a category of affine Lagrangian relations. Using this new presentation, we prove the equivalence of the prop of affine Lagrangian relations with the prop of qudit stabilizer theory in odd prime dimensions. We hence obtain a unified graphical language for several disparate process theories, including electrical circuits, Spekkens' toy theory, and odd-prime-dimensional stabilizer quantum circuits.}

Alternatively, a quantum circuit can be translated to a ZX-diagram which can be simplified using the rules of the ZX-calculus, after which a simplified circuit can be extracted. However, the best-known extraction procedures can drastically increase the number of 2-qubit gates. In this work, we take advantage of the fact that local changes in a ZX-diagram can drastically affect the complexity of the extracted circuit. We use a pair of congruences (i.e., non-simplification rewrite rules) based on the graph-theoretic notions of local complementation and pivoting to generate local variants of a simplified ZX-diagram. We explore the space of equivalent ZX-diagrams generated by these congruences using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms to obtain a simplified circuit with fewer 2-qubit gates. On randomly generated circuits, our method can outperform state-of-the-art optimization techniques for low-qubit (<10) circuits. On a set of previously reported benchmark circuits with <=14 qubits, our method outperforms off-the-shelf methods in 87% of cases, consistently reducing overall circuit complexity by an additional ~15-30% and eliminating up to 46% of 2-qubit gates. These preliminary results serve as a proof-of-concept for a new circuit optimization strategy in the ZX-calculus.}

We have constructed a procedure that takes the complementary classical structures of a single qubit system and compose them separably via the Kronecker product or 'entangle' them via Bell states to obtain complementary classical structures in n-qubit systems. In this present work, we apply our procedure to two qubit and three qubit systems as examples. Then, using rewriting rules of ZX-calculus and tools in graph theory, we searched for maximal complete sets of mutually complementary classical structures (the categorical counterpart of mutually unbiased bases) among our constructed composite classical structures. For two qubits, we found 13 maximal complete sets of mutually complementary classical structures, and for three qubits, we found 32,448 maximal complete sets of mutually complementary classical structures.}

Recently it was shown that quantum circuits can be classically simulated by expressing the non-stabiliser gates in a circuit as magic state injections and decomposing them in chunks of 2-6 states at a time, obtaining sums of (efficiently-simulable) stabiliser states with many fewer terms than the naive approach. We adapt these techniques from the original setting of Clifford circuits with magic state injection to generic ZX-diagrams and show that, by interleaving this "chunked" decomposition with a ZX-calculus-based simplification strategy, we can obtain stabiliser decompositions that are many orders of magnitude smaller than existing approaches. We illustrate this technique to perform exact norm calculations (and hence strong simulation) on the outputs of random 50- and 100-qubit Clifford+T circuits with up to 70 T-gates as well as a family of hidden shift circuits previously considered by Bravyi and Gosset with over 1000 T-gates.}

Causal flow and generalised flow have already been shown as sufficient, with efficient algorithms for identifying these properties and performing the circuit extraction. Pauli flow is a weaker set of conditions that extends generalised flow to use the knowledge that some vertices are measured in a Pauli basis. In this paper, we show that Pauli flow can similarly be identified efficiently and that any measurement pattern whose underlying graph admits a Pauli flow can be efficiently transformed into a gate-based circuit without using ancilla qubits. We then use this relationship to derive simulation results for the effects of graph-theoretic rewrites in the ZX-calculus using a more circuit-like data structure we call the Pauli Dependency DAG.}

However, the interpretation of the W spider in this type of ZW-calculus has so-called q-binomial coefficients involved, thus makes computation quite complicated. In this paper, we give a new type of qudit ZW-calculus which has generators and rewriting rules similar to that of the qubit ZW-calculus. Especially, the Z spider is exactly the same as that of the qudit ZX-calculus as given in \cite{wangqufinite}, and the new W spider has much simpler interpretation as a linear map.

In the process we show how the SU(2) invariance of Wigner symbols is trivially provable in the ZXH-calculus. Additionally, we show how we can explicitly diagrammatically calculate 3jm, 4jm and 6j symbols. It has long been thought that quantum gravity should be closely aligned to quantum information theory.

This equation called the bialgebra rule and making two spiders interact is the key ingredient in the definition of Z*-algebras in Chapter 6 where it is shown that the red and green spiders are not the only ones following this pattern. The introduction of Z*-algebras and the classification of all their models in qubits is the second contribution of this thesis. There are essentially three such structures for qubits, corresponding to the ZX-calculus, ZH-calculus, and ZW-calculus. Similar behaviour can also appear in other settings, as in the graphical linear algebra introduced in Chapter 7. All those calculi can then be used to represent quantum algorithms. But there are two obstacles. First, those algorithms can involve interactions with the non-quantum world that require a broader model of computation allowing classical behaviours alongside quantum ones.
    This is called mixed state quantum mechanics and a way to extend quantum graphical languages to this setting is presented in Chapter 8. The extension of ZX-calculus to mixed-state quantum mechanics is the third contribution presented in this thesis. A second obstacle is the fact that a quantum algorithm is defined by a uniform family of circuits, one for each possible size of the input. The scalable notations presented in Chapter 9 allow to handle such families, completing the toolbox necessary to calmly approach quantum algorithm graphically. The scalable notations are the fourth and last theoretical contribution of this thesis.
    All those methods can be used to graphically prove the correction of quantum algorithms. Examples are provided in Chapter 10, which concludes the thesis.}

Quantum circuits can be optimized in an intuitive and efficient way by transforming them to equivalent ZX-diagrams and using rules of the ZX-calculus for diagram simplification. However, some rules can modify ZX-diagrams in such a way that the re-extraction of a quantum circuit is no longer possible. Moreover, rules that simplify ZX-diagrams can still increase the size of the underlying circuits. Due to these problems, most of the existing ZXcalculus based optimization approaches become inefficient with increasing quantum circuit complexity. In our work we develop different strategies to improve those approaches. In particular, we introduce heuristics to estimate the optimization benefit gained by certain ZX-rules. This allows treating ZX-diagram simplification as a classical search problem where heuristics can be applied to guide the sequence of rule applications towards minimal circuits. We implement different heuristic-based algorithms like greedy search, random search and simulated annealing in the open-source library PyZX where we test them against existing strategies on circuits of variant size. The results show that using heuristics in diagram simplification often leads to better overall optimization results, especially when optimizing large and complex quantum circuits. Our algorithms can be further improved in several aspects like runtime or consideration of hardware topology.

This work, based on the pure-quantum circuit optimization procedure by Duncan et al., uses an extension of the formal graphical ZX-calculus called ZX-ground as an intermediary representation of the hybrid circuits to allow for granular optimizations below the quantum-gate level. We define a translation from hybrid circuits into diagrams that admit the graph-theoretical focused-gFlow property, needed for the final extraction back into a circuit. We then derive a number of gFlow-preserving optimization rules for ZX-ground diagrams that reduce the size of the graph, and devise an strategy to find optimization opportunities by rewriting the diagram guided by a Gauss elimination process. Then, after extracting the circuit, we present a general procedure for detecting segments of circuit-like ZX-ground diagrams which can be implemented with classical gates in the extracted circuit. We have implemented our optimization procedure as an extension to the open-source python library PyZX.}

We show here how, by considering certain non-stabiliser entangled states which have more favourable decompositions, we can speed up these simulations. This is made possible by using the ZX-calculus, which allows us to easily find instances of these entangled states in the simplified diagram representing the quantum circuit to be simulated. We additionally find a new technique of partial stabiliser decompositions that allow us to trade magic states for stabiliser terms. With this technique we require only $2^{\alpha t}$ stabiliser terms, where $\alpha\approx 0.396$, to simulate a circuit with T-count $t$. This matches the $\alpha$ found by Qassim et al., but whereas they only get this scaling in the asymptotic limit, ours applies for a circuit of any size. Our method builds upon a recently proposed scheme for simulation combining stabiliser decompositions and optimisation strategies implemented in the software QuiZX. With our techniques we manage to reliably simulate 50-qubit 1400 T-count hidden shift circuits in a couple of minutes on a consumer laptop.}

    abstract = {The ZX-calculus is a graphical language for reasoning about quantum computation using ZX-diagrams, a certain flexible generalisation of quantum circuits that can be used to represent linear maps from $m$ to $n$ qubits for any $m,n \geq 0$. Some applications for the ZX-calculus, such as quantum circuit optimisation and synthesis, rely on being able to efficiently translate a ZX-diagram back into a quantum circuit of comparable size. While several sufficient conditions are known for describing families of ZX-diagrams that can be efficiently transformed back into circuits, it has previously been conjectured that the general problem of circuit extraction is hard. That is, that it should not be possible to efficiently convert an arbitrary ZX-diagram describing a unitary linear map into an equivalent quantum circuit. In this paper we prove this conjecture by showing that the circuit extraction problem is #P-hard, and so is itself at least as hard as strong simulation of quantum circuits. In addition to our main hardness result, which relies specifically on the circuit representation, we give a representation-agnostic hardness result. Namely, we show that any oracle that takes as input a ZX-diagram description of a unitary and produces samples of the output of the associated quantum computation enables efficient probabilistic solutions to NP-complete problems.}

    abstract = {The ZX-calculus is a powerful framework for reasoning in quantum computing. It provides in particular a compact representation of matrices of interests. A peculiar property of the ZX-calculus is the absence of a formal sum allowing the linear combinations of arbitrary ZX-diagrams. The universality of the formalism guarantees however that for any two ZX-diagrams, the sum of their interpretations can be represented by a ZX-diagram. We introduce a general, inductive definition of the addition of ZX-diagrams, relying on the construction of controlled diagrams. Based on this addition technique, we provide an inductive differentiation of ZX-diagrams.   Indeed, given a ZX-diagram with variables in the description of its angles, one can differentiate the diagram according to one of these variables. Differentiation is ubiquitous in quantum mechanics and quantum computing (e.g. for solving optimization problems). Technically, differentiation of ZX-diagrams is strongly related to summation as witnessed by the product rules.   We also introduce an alternative, non inductive, differentiation technique rather based on the isolation of the variables. Finally, we apply our results to deduce a diagram for an Ising Hamiltonian.}

We provide several new ZX-diagram rewrite rules and generalizations for this setting. In particular, we give formal rules for dealing with linear combinations of ZX-diagrams, where the relative complex-valued scale factors of each diagram must be kept track of, in contrast to most previously studied single-diagram realizations where these coefficients can be effectively ignored. This allows us to directly import a number useful relations from the operator analysis to ZX-calculus setting, including causal cone and quantum gate commutation rules. We demonstrate that the diagrammatic approach offers useful insights into algorithm structure and performance by considering several ans\"atze from the literature including realizations of hardware-efficient ans\"atze and QAOA. We find that by employing a diagrammatic representation, calculations across different ans\"atze can become more intuitive and potentially easier approach systematically than by alternative means. Finally, we outline how diagrammatic approaches may aid in the design and study of new and more effective quantum circuit ans\"atze.}

In this calculus phase gadgets look as you would expect, but there are non-trivial differences in their properties. We devise new qutrit-specific tricks to extend the graphical Fourier theory of qubits, resulting in a translation between the 'additive' phase gadgets and a 'multiplicative' counterpart we dub phase multipliers. This enables us to build different types of qutrit multiple-controlled phase gates. As an application of these results we find a construction for emulating arbitrary qubit diagonal unitaries, and specifically find an emulation for the qubit CCZ gate that only requires three single-qutrit non-Clifford gates to implement - provably lower than the four T gates needed using just qubit gates.}

Recently, new methods have been proposed that tackle this problem from widely different perspectives. One of them is based on the ZX-calculus, a graphical rewriting system for quantum computing. However, the power and capability of this equivalence checking method has barely been explored. The aim of this work is to evaluate the ZX-calculus as a tool for equivalence checking of quantum circuits. To this end, it is demonstrated how the ZX-calculus-based approach to equivalence checking can be expanded in order to verify the results of compilation flows and optimizations on quantum circuits. It is also shown that the ZX-calculus based method is not complete — especially for quantum circuits with ancillary qubits. In order to properly evaluate the proposed method we conduct a detailed case study by comparing it to a prominent method in equivalence checking based on decision diagrams.}

The stabilisers of a CSS code have an especially nice structure arising from a pair of orthogonal $\mathbb F_2$-linear subspaces, or in the case of maximal CSS codes, a single subspace and its orthocomplement. On the other hand, phase-free ZX diagrams can always be efficiently reduced to a normal form given by the basis elements of an $\mathbb F_2$-linear subspace. Here, we will show that these two ways of describing a quantum state by an $\mathbb F_2$-linear subspace $S$ are in fact the same. Namely, the maximal CSS code generated by $S$ fixes the quantum state whose ZX normal form is also given by $S$.   This insight gives us an immediate translation from stabilisers of a maximal CSS code into a ZX diagram describing its associated state. We show that we can extend this translation to stabilisers and logical operators of any (possibly non-maximal) CSS code by "bending wires". To demonstrate the utility of this translation, we give a simple picture of the surface code and a fully graphical derivation of the action of physical lattice surgery operations on the space of logical qubits, completing the ZX presentation of lattice surgery initiated by de Beudrap and Horsman.}

Furthermore, we give a unique canonical form for stabilizer ZX-diagrams inspired by recent work of Hu & Khesin [arXiv:2109.10210]. We prove that any MBQC-like stabilizer ZX-diagram with Pauli flow can be rewritten into this canonical form using only rules which preserve the existence of Pauli flow and that each of these rules can be reversed while also preserving the existence of Pauli flow.

Using Monte Carlo sampling, I show that these improvements increase the threshold of the surface code when compiling into pair measurements from $\approx 0.2\%$ to $\approx 0.4\%$, and also that they improve the teraquop footprint at a $0.1\%$ physical gate error rate from $\approx6000$ qubits to $\approx3000$ qubits. However, I also show that Chao et al's construction will have a smaller teraquop footprint for physical gate error rates below $\approx 0.03\%$ (due to bidirectional hook errors in my construction). I also compare to the planar honeycomb code, showing that although this work does noticeably reduce the gap between the surface code and the honeycomb code (when compiling into pair measurements), the honeycomb code is still more efficient (threshold $\approx 0.8\%$, teraquop footprint at $0.1\%$ of $\approx 1000$).}

    abstract = {Diagrams are ubiquitous in physics and have catalysed progress on numerous occasions. From
tensor networks and quantum circuits to Feynman diagrams, there are few areas of physics
that don’t employ some informal pictorial reasoning. These diagrams represent the underlying
mathematical operations and aid physical interpretation, but cannot generally be computed
with directly. In this thesis the ZXH-calculus, a graphical language based on the ZX-calculus,
is offered as a prototype for a formal diagrammatic calculational tool for theoretical physics
involving spin. This extends the ZXH-calculus (and more broadly the ZX family of calculi to
which it belongs) beyond its traditional domain which has largely been dominated by quantum
computing. In order to do this the spin lattices taken from condensed matter physics are studied.
It is also shown how spin-networks of the form often seen as the state-space of loop quantum
gravity (LQG) can diagrammatised along with operators acting on them.
To achieve this a diagrammatic form of SU(2) representation theory is outlined. Following this
in condensed matter a number of results are shown. The 1D AKLT state, a symmetry protected
topological state, is expressed in the ZXH-calculus by developing a representation of spins higher
than 1/2 within the calculus. By exploiting the simplifying power of the ZXH-calculus rules it
is shown how this representation straightforwardly recovers the AKLT matrix-product state
representation, the existence of topologically protected edge states, and the non-vanishing of a
string order parameter. Extending beyond these known properties, the diagrammatic approach
also allows one to analytically derive that the Berry phase of any finite-length 1D AKLT chain
is π. In addition, an alternative proof that the 2D AKLT state on a hexagonal lattice can be
reduced to a graph state, demonstrating that it is a universal quantum computing resource.
Continuing on the theme of condensed matter it is then shown how one can build 2D higher-order
topological phases diagrammatically, which is used to illustrate a symmetry-breaking phase
transition.
Turning to LQG the first step is the analysis of Yutsis diagrams, a standard graphical calculus
used in quantum chemistry and quantum gravity, which captures the main features of SU(2)
representation theory. Second, it is shown how it embeds within Penrose’s binor calculus. The
two are then rewritten as ZXH-diagrams. In the process we show how the SU(2) invariance
of Wigner symbols is trivially provable in the ZXH-calculus. Additionally, we show how we
can explicitly diagrammatically calculate 3jm, 4jm and 6j symbols. It has long been thought
that quantum gravity should be closely aligned to quantum information theory. In this paper,
we present a way in which this connection can be made exact, by writing the spin-networks
of loop quantum gravity in the ZX-diagrammatic language of quantum computation. Finally
after outlining the motivation for considering spin-networks as the quantisation of space, the
geometric operators are discussed, and in specific cases diagrammatic versions of the operators
are provided. More generally what is done here shows a route by which LQG can be interpreted
in quantum informational terms by rewriting its kinematical states as networks of qubits in
ZXH.
In total these results demonstrate that the ZXH-calculus is a powerful language for representing
quantum systems and even allows for the computation on physical states entirely graphically.
Within condensed matter it is hoped this will pave the way to develop more efficient many-body
algorithms and giving a novel diagrammatic perspective on quantum phase transitions. In
LQG it is hoped this re-imagining of its state space will spur further integration of quantum
information and gravity.}

However, in order to capitalize on these prospects, a fully automated quantum software stack needs to be developed. This involves a multitude of complex tasks from the classical simulation of quantum circuits, over their compilation to specific devices, to the verification of the circuits to be executed as well as the obtained results. All of these tasks are highly non-trivial and necessitate efficient data structures to tackle the inherent complexity. Starting from rather straight-forward arrays over decision diagrams (inspired by the design automation community) to tensor networks and the ZX-calculus, various complementary approaches have been proposed. This work provides a look "under the hood" of today's tools and showcases how these means are utilized in them, e.g., for simulation, compilation, and verification of quantum circuits.},

abstract = {As state-of-the-art quantum computers are capable of running increasingly complex algorithms, the need for automated methods to design and test potential applications rises. Equivalence checking of quantum circuits is an important, yet hardly automated, task in the development of the quantum software stack. Recently, new methods have been proposed that tackle this problem from widely different perspectives. One of them is based on the ZX-calculus, a graphical rewriting system for quantum computing. However, the power and capability of this equivalence checking method has barely been explored. The aim of this work is to evaluate the ZX-calculus as a tool for equivalence checking of quantum circuits. To this end, it is demonstrated how the ZX-calculus based approach for equivalence checking can be expanded in order to verify the results of compilation flows and optimizations on quantum circuits. It is also shown that the ZX-calculus based method is not complete–especially for quantum circuits with ancillary qubits. In order to properly evaluate the proposed method, we conduct a detailed case study by comparing it to two other state-of-the-art methods for equivalence checking: one based on path-sums and another based on decision diagrams. The proposed methods have been integrated into the publicly available QCEC tool (https://github.com/cda-tum/qcec) which is part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT).}

The PyZX compiler broke new ground by optimizing circuits via the ZX calculus, a powerful graphical alternative to the quantum circuit model. Still, it carries no guarantee of its correctness. To address this, we developed VyZX, a verified ZX-calculus in the Coq proof assistant. VyZX provides two distinct representations of ZX diagrams for ease of programming and proof: A graph-based representation for writing high-level functions on diagrams and a block-based representation for proving ZX diagrams equivalent. Through these two different views, VyZX provides the tools necessary to verify properties and transformations of ZX diagrams. This paper explores the proofs and design choices underlying VyZX and its application and the challenges of verifying a graphical programming language.}

We consider as the cost function the expectation value of a Hamiltonian that is a sum of local terms. For randomly chosen variational parameters we show that the variance of the cost function gradient decreases exponentially with the distance of a Hamiltonian term from the canonical centre in the quantum tensor network. Therefore, as a function of qubit count, for qMPS most gradient variances decrease exponentially and for qTTN as well as qMERA they decrease polynomially. We also show that the calculation of these gradients is exponentially more efficient on a classical computer than on a quantum computer.}

We outline their reduction from \#SAT to evaluating ZH diagrams, which shows that evaluating ZH diagrams is \#P-hard, and we extend this to show that evaluating diagrams in certain fragments of the ZH calculus, is $FP^{\#P}$-complete. In particular, we show this holds for diagrams where all H-boxes have labels in $\mathbb{Q}[i,\sqrt{2}]$, which includes both the Clifford+T and Toffoli-Hadamard fragments natively [BKM+21]. We show the action of the DPLL algorithm [DLL62] for SAT and its derivative CDP [BL99] for \#SAT in terms of ZH-diagrams, and use diagrammatic methods to extend CDP to treat variables and clauses equally. Combining this with an algorithm for \#2SAT by Wahlström [Wah08], we derive novel upper bounds in terms of clauses and variables for \#kSAT that are independent of $k$, and better than brute-force for small clause densities of $\frac{m}{n} < 2.25$.
This improves on the upper bound of Dubois [Dub91] whenever $\frac{m}{n} < 1.858$ and $k \geq 4$, and the average-case analysis by Williams [Wil04] whenever $\frac{m}{n} < 1.217$ and $k \geq 6$. We also obtain an unconditional upper bound of
$O∗(1.88m)$ for \#4SAT in terms of clauses only.
Finally, we find novel stabilizer decompositions of certain ZH-diagrams and use this to adapt the algorithm of Kissinger and van de Wetering [Kv21] [KvV22] for evaluating ZX-diagrams using stabilizer decompositions to evaluate \#2SAT instances. We examine the effect of different decomposition strategies on its runtime but conclude that the algorithm as given is not

An essential step in performing QNLP tasks is converting DisCoCat string diagrams into quantum circuits, through a mapping known as an ansatz. While several ans\"{a}tze have been studied in the broader quantum machine learning literature, no comparative study of ans\"{a}tze exists for the specific case of QNLP models. In this work, we implement multiple ans\"{a}tze and compare their performance on a variety of QNLP tasks. In doing so, the first experimental results for a QNLP model applied to the paraphrase identification task are presented. We propose a novel approach to overcome the out-of-vocabulary problem faced by contemporary QNLP models, and demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms naive approaches by a significant margin. Further, experimental results relating to the barren plateau phenomenon in quantum machine learning are provided. We present evidence suggesting that circuits derived from DisCoCat string diagrams for binary classification tasks are no more susceptible to the barren plateau problem than regular quantum machine learning circuits.}

First, we discuss algorithms to compute gradients on quantum hardware that are needed to perform gradient-based optimisation for QML. Concretely, we give new diagrammatic proofs of the common 2- and 4-term parameter shift rules used in the literature. Additionally, we derive a novel, generalised parameter shift rule with 2n terms that is applicable to gates that can be represented with n parametrised spiders in the ZXW-calculus. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, we give the first proof of a conjecture by Anselmetti et al. by proving a no-go theorem ruling out more efficient alternatives to the 4-term shift rule. Secondly, we analyse the gradient landscape of quantum ans¨atze for barren plateaus using both empirical and analytical techniques. Concretely, we develop a tool that automatically calculates the variance of gradients and use it to detect likely barren plateaus in commonly used quantum ans¨atze. Furthermore, we formally prove the existence or absence of barren plateaus for a selection of ans\"{a}tze using diagrammatic techniques from the ZXW-calculus.}

In the Ising case, this reduces to a familiar rule relating two distinct Euler decompositions of the Hadamard gate as $\pi/2$ phase rotations, whereas in the Fibonacci case, we give a previously unconsidered exact solution of the P-rule involving the Golden ratio. We demonstrate the utility of these representations by giving graphical derivations of the single-qubit braid equations for Fibonacci anyons and the single- and two-qubit braid equations for Ising anyons.}

The T gate, except being crucial for the universality, is the one which is, in real-world implementations, the most resource-intensive, and the least fault-tolerant of all operations. Because of that, a natural question emerges – how to reduce the number of T gates (or T-count) in a given circuit. The known methods used to reduce the T-count to an optimal value have an exponential running time [24, 2], which motivates the search for an efficient heuristic algorithm. The importance of this problem, along with proposed solutions were discussed in multiple publications including [6, 18, 16, 15, 7, 23]. Spider nest identities, introduced in [16], together with the decomposition of the circuit inspired by [18], were combined in [15] to provide an effective algorithm for T-count reduction. This approach was tested and compared with previous results, and, in some cases, it resulted in a significant improvement of the state of the art. Another advantage of this algorithm was, in contrast to the other results, a significant improvement of the execution time. In this dissertation, we discuss several modifications of the algorithm in order to gain partial outperformance without a significant increase of the running time, which include analysis of the influence of the order of applying the identities, efficient usage of identities generated from small and big spider nests, combining the results obtained in [25] with spider nest identities, and others. Some of these modifications improve or achieve the current state of the art for various circuits. We also provide a quantitative comparison of results, verified using [3] – a tool created alongside [4], on numerous benchmark circuits obtained from [9, 26, 3]. Moreover, we present abstract formulations of considered problem, pose a question of completeness of spider nest identities with respect to T-count reduction, and present different, possibly more elegant, way of phrasing the spider nest identities, as dense spider nest identities.}

In this dissertation, we hope to leverage the existing work on quantum graphical languages such as the ZX-calculus to aid one of the most prominent classical simulation tools, tensor network methods. By their very nature, graphical languages have a more modular representation of quantum circuits, which could be optimized using the associated rewrite rules of the calculi. We investigate how effective the existing procedures are at enhancing tensor network contractions and propose new strategies based on our observations. Furthermore, we evaluate our strategies using a variety of circuits, including the Sycamore circuits used by Google to demonstrate quantum supremacy in 2019.}

To circumvent the traditionally low thresholds of small fixed-width arrays, we deliberately engineer an error bias at the lowest level of encoding using the surface code. We then address this engineered bias at a higher level of encoding using a lattice-surgery surface code bus that exploits this bias, or a repetition code to make logical qubits with unbiased errors out of biased surface code qubits. Arbitrarily low error rates can then be reached by further concatenating with other codes, such as Steane [[7,1,3]] code and the [[15,7,3]] CSS code. This enables a scalable fixed-width quantum computing architecture on a square qubit lattice that is only 19 qubits wide, given physical qubits with an error rate of $8.0\times 10^{-4}$. This potentially eases engineering issues in systems with fine qubit pitches, such as quantum dots in silicon or gallium arsenide.}

We introduce an architecture using non-2D-local connections in which the cost does not scale with the number of qubits, and instead only with the number of logical operations. Each logical operation has an associated active volume, such that the cost of a quantum computation can be quantified as a sum of active volumes of all operations. For quantum computations with thousands of logical qubits, the active volume can be orders of magnitude lower than the circuit volume. Importantly, the architecture does not require all-to-all connectivity between N logical qubits. Instead, each logical qubit is connected to O(log N) other sites. As an example, we show that, using the same number of logical qubits, a 2048-bit factoring algorithm can be executed 44 times faster than on a general-purpose architecture without non-local connections. With photonic qubits, long-range connections are available and we show how photonic components can be used to construct a fusion-based active-volume quantum computer.}

Using graphical reasoning, we find a reduction from #SAT to $\#2SAT_\pm$ in the ZH-calculus. We observe that the DPLL algorithm for #2SAT can be adapted to $\#2SAT_\pm$ directly and hence that Wahlstrom's $O^*(1.2377^n)$ upper bound applies to $\#2SAT_\pm$ as well. Combining this with our reduction from #SAT to $\#2SAT_\pm$ gives us novel upper bounds in terms of clauses and variables that are better than $O^*(2^n)$ for small clause densities of $\frac{m}{n} < 2.25$. This is to our knowledge the first non-trivial upper bound for #SAT that is independent of clause size. Our algorithm improves on Dubois' upper bound for $\#kSAT$ whenever $\frac{m}{n} < 1.85$ and $k \geq 4$, and the Williams' average-case analysis whenever $\frac{m}{n} < 1.21$ and $k \geq 6$.

The grammatical structure of text and sentences connects the meaning of words in the same way that entanglement structure connects the states of quantum systems. Category theory allows to make this language-to-qubit analogy formal: it is a monoidal functor from grammar to vector spaces. We turn this abstract analogy into a concrete algorithm that translates the grammatical structure onto the architecture of parameterised quantum circuits. We then use a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to train the model so that evaluating the circuits computes the meaning of sentences in data-driven tasks.   The implementation of QNLP models motivated the development of DisCoPy (Distributional Compositional Python), the toolkit for applied category theory of which the first chapter gives a comprehensive overview. String diagrams are the core data structure of DisCoPy, they allow to reason about computation at a high level of abstraction. We show how they can encode both grammatical structures and quantum circuits, but also logical formulae, neural networks or arbitrary Python code. Monoidal functors allow to translate these abstract diagrams into concrete computation, interfacing with optimised task-specific libraries.   The second chapter uses DisCopy to implement QNLP models as parameterised functors from grammar to quantum circuits. It gives a first proof-of-concept for the more general concept of functorial learning: generalising machine learning from functions to functors by learning from diagram-like data. In order to learn optimal functor parameters via gradient descent, we introduce the notion of diagrammatic differentiation: a graphical calculus for computing the gradients of parameterised diagrams.}

These are quantum circuits where the unitary it implements is diagonal. In this paper we introduce improved techniques for classically simulating random IQP circuits. We find a simple algorithm to calculate an amplitude of an $n$-qubit IQP circuit with dense random two-qubit interactions in time $O(\frac{\log^2 n}{n} 2^n )$, which for sparse circuits (where each qubit interacts with $O(\log n)$ other qubits) runs in $o(2^n/\text{poly}(n))$ for any given polynomial. Using a more complicated stabiliser decomposition approach we improve the algorithm for dense circuits to $O\left(\frac{(\log n)^{4-\beta}}{n^{2-\beta}} 2^n \right)$ where $\beta \approx 0.396$. We benchmarked our algorithm and found that we can simulate up to 50-qubit circuits in a couple of minutes on a laptop. We estimate that 70-qubit circuits are within reach for a large computing cluster.}

    abstract = {The use of quantum graphical calculi, such as the ZX-calculus, has lead to great advances in fields such as quantum circuit optimization. Particularly the ZH-calculus has proven useful for reasoning about higher-level quantum operations, such as Toffoli and Hadamard gates, which form an approximately universal set of gates, for which the qubit ZH-calculus is complete. More recently, quantum computing based on d-ary basis states has gained traction, with the ZX- and ZW-calculi having been generalized to higher dimensions. However, no generalization of the ZH-calculus is known. Such a generalization might lead to new insights about higher-dimensional equivalents of the Toffoli-gate. In this dissertation, we provide this generalization of the qubit ZH-calculus to qudits by generalizing a classification of qubit quantum graphical calculi due to Carette and Jeandel by relaxing a condition that would have excluded a qudit ZH-calculus from being constructed. We then use this generalization to reduce the ruleset of the qubit ZH-calculus by one rule. Additionally, we give a first-of-its-kind algorithm for constructing ZH-diagrams from the matrix representation of linear maps, and use this algorithm to show that, for prime dimension, ZH-calculus is universal.}

    abstract = {In the near term, programming quantum computers will remain severely limited by low quantum volumes. Therefore, it is desirable to implement quantum circuits with the fewest resources possible. For the common Clifford+T circuits, most research is focused on reducing the number of T gates, since they are an order of magnitude more expensive than Clifford gates in quantum error corrected encoding schemes. However, this optimization sometimes leads to more 2-qubit gates, which, even though they are less expensive in terms of fault-tolerance, contribute significantly to the overall circuit cost. Approaches based on the ZX-calculus have recently gained some popularity in the field, but reduction of 2-qubit gates is not their focus. In this work, we present an alternative for improving 2-qubit gate count of a quantum circuit with the ZX-calculus by using heuristics in ZX-diagram simplification. Our approach maintains the good reduction of the T gate count provided by other strategies based on ZX-calculus, thus serving as an extension for other optimization algorithms. Our results show that combining the available ZX-calculus-based optimizations with our algorithms can reduce the number of 2-qubit gates by as much as 40\% compared to current approaches using ZXcalculus. Additionally, we improve the results of the best currently available optimization technique of Nam et. al [22] for some circuits by up to 15\%.}

    abstract = {In this thesis, we present various contributions to the different stages of a quantum compiler toolchain. Our first contribution is the definition of a new intermediate representation for quantum programs based on an extension of the ZX calculus called Scalable ZX (SZX), which allows us to compactly represent quantum circuits repeated structure. We introduce a non-trivial fragment of the Proto-Quipper-D language and present its encoding into families of such SZX-diagrams, that can be used to optimize recurrent segments of the program in a single optimization pass. This intermediate representation can then be transformed into a ZX diagram or a quantum circuit to continue the compilation process. This work was first presented at the International Workshop on Programming Languages for Quantum Computing (PLanQC 2022), and a full version was published in the proceedings of the Quantum Physics and Logic Conference (QPL 2022). A second contribution of this work is the definition of a new optimization procedure for quantum circuits containing both quantum and classical segments, based on the method by Duncan et al. We are able to use an extension of the ZX calculus called ZX Ground to represent such hybrid programs, and optimize programs that encode some communication between the quantum and classical components. A preliminary version of this work was first presented in the proceedings of the International Workshop on Quantum Compilation (IWQC 2020), and finally published at the Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems (APLAS 2021). We have implemented our optimization procedure as an extension of the ZX-diagram manipulation tool pyzx, and upstreamed some of the changes to the main repository. Finally, our last contribution pertains to the detection of classical segments in a hybrid quantum-classical circuit. Some automated optimization processes such as the one we present may produce circuits that computes quantumly some operations that could be performed classically using fewer resources. We formalise the classicalisation problem and present an efficient heuristic to detect such segments. This work was developed jointly with the optimization procedure for hybrid quantum-classical circuits, and a succinct version was published along it at APLAS 2021.}

Conceptually, EQGCs serve as a unifying framework for quantum graph representation learning, allowing us to define several interesting subclasses subsuming existing proposals. In terms of the representation power, we prove that the subclasses of interest are universal approximators for functions over the bounded graph domain. This theoretical perspective on quantum graph machine learning methods opens many directions for further work, and could lead to models with capabilities beyond those of classical approaches. We also provide experimental evidence, and observe that the performance of EQGCs scales well with the depth of the model.}

abstract = {Practical distributed quantum computing requires the development of efficient compilers, able to make quantum circuits compatible with some given hardware constraints. This problem is known to be tough, even for local computing. Here, we address it on distributed architectures. As generally assumed in this scenario, telegates represent the fundamental remote (inter-processor) operations. Each telegate consists of several tasks: i) entanglement generation and distribution, ii) local operations, and iii) classical communications. Entanglement generations and distribution is an expensive resource, as it is time-consuming. To mitigate its impact, we model an optimization problem that combines running-time minimization with the usage of distributed entangled states. Specifically, we formulated the distributed compilation problem as a dynamic network flow. To enhance the solution space, we extend the formulation, by introducing a predicate that manipulates the circuit given in input and parallelizes telegate tasks. To evaluate our framework, we split the problem into three sub-problems, and solve it by means of an approximation routine. Experiments demonstrate that the run-time is resistant to the problem size scaling. Moreover, we apply the proposed algorithm to compile circuits under different topologies, showing that topologies with a higher ratio between edges and nodes give rise to shallower circuits},

    abstract = {In this thesis, we are interested in the development of a Curry-Howard correspondence for quantum computing, allowing to represent quantum types and quantum control-flow. In the standard model of Quantum Computation, a classical computer is linked to a quantum coprocessor. The classical computer can then send instructions to allocate, update, or read quantum registers. The programs executed by the coprocessor are represented by a quantum circuit: a sequence of instructions that applies unitary operations to the input quantum bits. While the model is universal, in the sense that it can represent any unitary operations, it stays limited: it lacks of proper representation of non-causal execution flow. Normally, to represent branching, one can use a type system featuring a coproduct, allowing for the choice between two possible executions, but quantum circuits only feature qubits and tensors thereof. On the other hand, types and strongly related to logic via the Curry-Howard correspondence which states that types of programs correspond to formulas and programs to proofs, while the program evaluation is matched with the proof simplification. While this correspondence has been extended to multiple setting in classical computer, it has yet to emerge in quantum computing. To address those problems we follow two different approaches: the first one, through the development of a linear and reversible programming language, capturing a subset of quantum computing, along with a Curry-Howard correspondence with the logic µMALL. The language comes in two versions: one representing exactly complete, reversible functions while the other one can represent partial functions. Both version comes with an expressivity result: in the former, one can capture the whole class of Primitive Recursive Functions, while in the later any Turing Machine we show how to capture any Turing Machine. The second approach follows the development of token-based semantics, inspired by Girard’s Geometry of Interaction, for graphical language for quantum computation. In this approach, a token-based semantics was given for the ZX-Calculus: a graphical language for quantum computation capable of representing any linear operators. We show how the token-based semantics matches the denotational one. We extend the ZX-Calculus with a coproduct and an explicit tensor in the development of the Many-Worlds Calculus. This new languages comes with a token-based semantics and an equational theory. We show how quantum control can be represented in this system. Finally, the programming language is modified to be able to realize pure quantum computation and the graphical language is then used as a denotational model for it. }

We construct a decomposition and prove the upper bound $\mathcal{O}(6^{2K})$ on the associated sampling overhead, where $K$ is the number of cuts in the circuit. This bound is independent of the number of control qubits but can be further reduced to $\mathcal{O}(4.5^{2K})$ for the special case of CCZ gates. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposal on IBM hardware and experimentally show noise resilience due to the strong reduction of CNOT gates in the cut circuits.}
