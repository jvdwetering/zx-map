  abstract = {ZX-calculus is a high-level graphical formalism for qubit computation. In this paper we give the ZX-rules that enable one to derive all equations between 2-qubit Clifford+T quantum circuits. Our rule set is only a small extension of the rules of stabilizer ZX-calculus, and substantially less than those needed for the recently achieved universal completeness. One of our rules is new, and we expect it to also have other utilities. 
    These ZX-rules are much simpler than the complete of set Clifford+T circuit equations due to Selinger and Bian, which indicates that ZX-calculus provides a more convenient arena for quantum circuit rewriting than restricting oneself to circuit equations. The reason for this is that ZX-calculus is not constrained by a fixed unitary gate set for performing intermediate computations.}

We give sufficient conditions for an axiomatisation to be complete, and an algorithm to reach the normal form. Finally, we apply these results to the Clifford+T fragment and the general ZX-Calculus -- for which we already know the completeness--, but also for any fragment of rational angles: we show that the axiomatisation for Clifford+T is also complete for any fragment of dyadic angles, and that a simple new rule (called cancellation) is necessary and sufficient otherwise.}

We prove that its $\pi/4$-fragment is not complete, in other words the ZX-calculus is not complete for the so called "Clifford+T quantum mechanics". The completeness of this fragment was one of the main open problems in categorical quantum mechanics, a programme initiated by Abramsky and Coecke. The ZX-calculus was known to be incomplete for quantum mechanics. On the other hand, its $\pi/2$-fragment is known to be complete, i.e. the ZX-calculus is complete for the so called "stabilizer quantum mechanics". Deciding whether its $\pi/4$-fragment is complete is a crucial step in the development of the ZX-calculus since this fragment is approximately universal for quantum mechanics, contrary to the $\pi/2$-fragment. To establish our incompleteness result, we consider a fairly simple property of quantum states called supplementarity. We show that supplementarity can be derived in the ZX-calculus if and only if the angles involved in this equation are multiples of $\pi/2$. In particular, the impossibility to derive supplementarity for $\pi/4$ implies the incompleteness of the ZX-calculus for Clifford+T quantum mechanics. As a consequence, we propose to add the supplementarity to the set of rules of the ZX-calculus. We also show that if a ZX-diagram involves antiphase twins, they can be merged when the ZX-calculus is augmented with the supplementarity rule. Merging antiphase twins makes diagrammatic reasoning much easier and provides a purely graphical meaning to the supplementarity rule.}

The completeness of the language -- i.e. the ability to derive any true equation -- is a crucial question. In the quest of a complete ZX-calculus, supplementarity has been recently proved to be necessary for quantum diagram reasoning (MFCS 2016). Roughly speaking, supplementarity consists in merging two subdiagrams when they are parameterized by antipodal angles. We introduce a generalised supplementarity -- called cyclotomic supplementarity -- which consists in merging n subdiagrams at once, when the n angles divide the circle into equal parts. We show that when n is an odd prime number, the cyclotomic supplementarity cannot be derived, leading to a countable family of new axioms for diagrammatic quantum reasoning.We exhibit another new simple axiom that cannot be derived from the existing rules of the ZX-Calculus, implying in particular the incompleteness of the language for the so-called Clifford+T quantum mechanics. We end up with a new axiomatisation of an extended ZX-Calculus, including an axiom schema for the cyclotomic supplementarity.}

We consider the full pure qubit quantum mechanics, and mainly prove two results: (i) First, the axiomatisation for Clifford+T quantum mechanics is also complete for all equations involving some kind of linear diagrams. The linearity of the diagrams reflects the phase group structure, an essential feature of the ZX-calculus. In particular all the axioms of the ZX-calculus are involving linear diagrams. (ii) We also show that the axiomatisation for Clifford+T is not complete in general but can be completed by adding a single (non linear) axiom, providing a simpler axiomatisation of the ZX-calculus for pure quantum mechanics than the one recently introduced by Ng&Wang.}

The resource states which play the role of graph states are prepared via 2-qubit gates of the form $\exp(−i\pi 2nZ\otimes Z)$. When $n=2$, these are equivalent, up to local Clifford unitaries, to graph states. However, when $n>2$, their behaviour diverges in two important ways. First, multiple applications of the entangling gate to a single pair of qubits produces non-trivial entanglement, and hence multiple parallel edges between nodes play an important role in these generalised graph states. Second, such a state can be used to realise deterministic, approximately universal computation using only Pauli Z and X measurements and feed-forward. Even though, for $n>2$, the relevant resource states are no longer stabiliser states, they admit a straightforward, graphical representation using the ZX-calculus. Using this representation, we are able to provide a simple, graphical proof of universality. We furthermore show that for every $n>2$ this family is capable of producing all Clifford gates and all diagonal gates in the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy.}

    abstract = {Quantum computing is moving rapidly to the point of deployment of technology. Functional quantum devices will require the ability to correct error in order to be scalable and effective. A leading choice of error correction, in particular for modular or distributed architectures, is the surface code with logical two-qubit operations realised via "lattice surgery". These operations consist of "merges" and "splits" acting non-unitarily on the logical states and are not easily captured by standard circuit notation. This raises the question of how best to reason about lattice surgery in order efficiently to use quantum states and operations in architectures with complex resource management issues. In this paper we demonstrate that the operations of the ZX calculus, a form of quantum diagrammatic reasoning designed using category theory, match exactly the operations of lattice surgery. Red and green "spider" nodes match rough and smooth merges and splits, and follow the axioms of a dagger special associative Frobenius algebra. Some lattice surgery operations can require non-trivial correction operations, which are captured natively in the use of the ZX calculus in the form of ensembles of diagrams. We give a first taste of the power of the calculus as a language for surgery by considering two operations (magic state use and producing a CNOT) and show how ZX diagram re-write rules give lattice surgery procedures for these operations that are novel, efficient, and highly configurable.}

The rewrite rules allow equalities to be derived entirely graphically, leading to the question of completeness: can any equality that is derivable using matrices also be derived graphically? The ZX-calculus is known to be complete for scalar-free pure qubit stabilizer quantum mechanics, meaning any equality between two pure stabilizer operators that is true up to a non-zero scalar factor can be derived using the graphical rewrite rules. Here, we replace those scalar-free rewrite rules with correctly scaled ones and show that, by adding one new diagram element and a new rewrite rule, the calculus can be made complete for pure qubit stabilizer quantum mechanics with scalars. This completeness property allows amplitudes and probabilities to be calculated entirely graphically. We also explicitly consider stabilizer zero diagrams, i.e. diagrams that represent a zero matrix, and show that two new rewrite rules suffice to make the calculus complete for those.}

In this framework, two equational diagrammatic calculi have been proposed for pure-state qubit quantum computing: the ZW calculus, developed by Coecke, Kissinger and the first author for the purpose of qubit entanglement classification, and the ZX calculus, introduced by Coecke and Duncan to give an abstract description of complementary observables. Neither calculus, however, provided a complete axiomatisation of their model.

    In this paper, we present extended versions of ZW and ZX, and show their completeness for pure-state qubit theory, thus solving two major open problems in categorical quantum mechanics. First, we extend the original ZW calculus to represent states and linear maps with coefficients in an arbitrary commutative ring, and prove completeness by a strategy that rewrites all diagrams into a normal form. We then extend the language and axioms of the original ZX calculus, and show their completeness for pure-state qubit theory through a translation between ZX and ZW specialised to the field of complex numbers. This translation expands the one used by Jeandel, Perdrix, and Vilmart to derive an axiomatisation of the approximately universal Clifford+T fragment; restricting the field of complex numbers to a suitable subring, we obtain an alternative axiomatisation of the same theory.}

Yet entanglement makes protocols presented in Dirac notation difficult to follow and check. This is why Coecke and Duncan have introduced a diagrammatic language for multi-qubit systems, called the red/green calculus or the ZX-calculus. This diagrammatic notation is both intuitive and formally rigorous. It is a simple, graphical, high level language that emphasises the composition of systems and naturally captures the essentials of quantum mechanics. One crucial feature that will be exploited here is the encoding of complementary observables and corresponding phase shifts. Reasoning is done by rewriting diagrams, i.e. locally replacing some part of a diagram. Diagrams are defined by their topology only; the number of inputs and outputs and the way they are connected. This exemplifies the 'flow' of information. For protocols involving multipartite entangled states, such as the GreenbergerHorne-Zeilinger and W-state, it will be shown that the zx-calculus provides a relatively easy and more intuitive presentation. Moreover, in this representation it is easier to check that protocols are correct. Protocols that will be discussed in detail are quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, leader election, superdense coding and quantum direct communication with multipartite entangled states.}

Here, we show that the ZX-calculus for single qubits remains complete upon adding the operator T to the single-qubit stabilizer operations. This is particularly interesting as the resulting single-qubit Clifford+T group is approximately universal, i.e. any unitary single-qubit operator can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy using only Clifford operators and T.}

We also axiomatize phase shifts within this framework. 
    Using the well-studied canonical correspondence between graphical calculi and symmetric monoidal categories, our results provide a purely graphical formalisation of complementarity for quantum observables. Each individual observable, represented by a commutative special dagger Frobenius algebra, gives rise to an abelian group of phase shifts, which we call the phase group. We also identify a strong form of complementarity, satisfied by the Z and X spin observables, which yields a scaled variant of a bialgebra.}

This nicely illustrates the respectively pairwise and global tripartite entanglement found in the W- and GHZ-class states. A new concept of supplementarity allows us to characterise inhabitants of the W class within the abstract diagrammatic calculus; these method extends to more general multipartite qubit states.}

While little is known about extracting an equivalent quantum circuit from an arbitrary ZX-diagram, we show that our simplification procedure preserves a graph property called focused gFlow, and use this property to derive a deterministic strategy for circuit re-extraction. Hence, this approach enables us to temporarily break the rigid quantum circuit structure and 'see around' obstructions (namely non-Clifford quantum gates) to produce significant reductions, while still maintaining enough data to extract a reduced quantum circuit at the end.}

The diagrammatic language is generated by two kinds of nodes: the so-called 'spider' associated with the computational basis, as well as a new arity-N generalisation of the Hadamard gate, which satisfies a variation of the spider fusion law. Unlike previous graphical calculi, this admits compact encodings of non-linear classical functions. For example, the AND gate can be depicted as a diagram of just 2 generators, compared to ~25 in the ZX-calculus. Consequently, N-controlled gates, hypergraph states, Hadamard+Toffoli circuits, and diagonal circuits at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy also enjoy encodings with low constant overhead. This suggests that this calculus will be significantly more convenient for reasoning about the interplay between classical non-linear behaviour (e.g. in an oracle) and purely quantum operations. After presenting the calculus, we will prove it is sound and complete for universal quantum computation by demonstrating the reduction of any diagram to an easily describable normal form.}

    In this paper, we present a full graphical axiomatisation of the relations between GHZ and W: the ZW calculus. This refines a version of the preexisting ZX calculus, while keeping its most desirable characteristics: undirectedness, a large degree of symmetry, and an algebraic underpinning.

  abstract = {String diagrams turn algebraic equations into topological moves that have recurring shapes, involving the sliding of one diagram past another. We individuate, at the root of this fact, the dual nature of polygraphs as presentations of higher algebraic theories, and as combinatorial descriptions of "directed spaces". Operations of polygraphs modelled on operations of topological spaces are used as the foundation of a compositional universal algebra, where sliding moves arise from tensor products of polygraphs. We reconstruct several higher algebraic theories in this framework. 
    In this regard, the standard formalism of polygraphs has some technical problems. We propose a notion of regular polygraph, barring cell boundaries that are not homeomorphic to a disk of the appropriate dimension. We define a category of non-degenerate shapes, and show how to calculate their tensor products. Then, we introduce a notion of weak unit to recover weakly degenerate boundaries in low dimensions, and prove that the existence of weak units is equivalent to a representability property. 
    We then turn to applications of diagrammatic algebra to quantum theory. We re-evaluate the category of Hilbert spaces from the perspective of categorical universal algebra, which leads to a bicategorical refinement. Then, we focus on the axiomatics of fragments of quantum theory, and present the ZW calculus, the first complete diagrammatic axiomatisation of the theory of qubits. 
The ZW calculus has several advantages over ZX calculi, including a computationally meaningful normal form, and a fragment whose diagrams can be read as setups of fermionic oscillators. Moreover, its generators reflect an operational classification of entangled states of 3 qubits. We conclude with generalisations of the ZW calculus to higher-dimensional systems, including the definition of a universal set of generators in each dimension.}

These models are also used to explore the question of $\psi$-ontic versus $\psi$-epistemic theories for quantum mechanics. Spekkens’ toy theory is one such model. It arises from classical probabilistic mechanics via a limit on the knowledge an observer may have about the state of a system. The toy theory for the simplest possible underlying system closely resembles stabilizer quantum mechanics, a fragment of quantum theory which is efficiently classically simulable but also non-local. Further analysis of the similarities and differences between those two theories can thus yield new insights into what distinguishes quantum theory from classical theories, and $\psi$-ontic from $\psi$-epistemic theories. In this paper, we develop a graphical language for Spekkens’ toy theory. Graphical languages offer intuitive and rigorous formalisms for the analysis of quantum mechanics and similar theories. To compare quantum mechanics and a toy model, it is useful to have similar formalisms for both. We show that our language fully describes Spekkens’ toy theory and in particular, that it is complete: meaning any equality that can be derived using other formalisms can also be derived entirely graphically. Our language is inspired by a similar graphical language for quantum mechanics called the ZX-calculus. Thus Spekkens’ toy bit theory and stabilizer quantum mechanics can be analysed and compared using analogous graphical formalisms.},

    abstract = {Graphical languages offer intuitive and rigorous formalisms for quantum physics. They can be used to simplify expressions, derive equalities, and do computations. Yet in order to replace conventional formalisms, rigour alone is not sufficient: the new formalisms also need to have equivalent deductive power. This requirement is captured by the property of completeness, which means that any equality that can be derived using some standard formalism can also be derived graphically. In this thesis, I consider the ZX-calculus, a graphical language for pure state qubit quantum mechanics. I show that it is complete for pure state stabilizer quantum mechanics, so any problem within this fragment of quantum theory can be fully analysed using graphical methods. This includes questions of central importance in areas such as error-correcting codes or measurement-based quantum computation. Furthermore, I show that the ZX-calculus is complete for the single-qubit Clifford+T group, which is approximately universal: any single-qubit unitary can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy using only Clifford gates and the T-gate. Lastly, I extend the use of rigorous graphical languages outside quantum theory to Spekkens' toy theory, a local hidden variable model that nevertheless exhibits some features commonly associated with quantum mechanics. I develop a graphical calculus similar to the ZX-calculus that fully describes Spekkens' toy theory, and show that it is complete. Hence, stabilizer quantum mechanics and Spekkens' toy theory can be fully analysed and compared using graphical formalisms. Intuitive graphical languages can replace conventional formalisms for the analysis of many questions in quantum computation and foundations without loss of mathematical rigour or deductive power.},

In the recent years, one of the main achievements of the categorical approach to quantum mechanics has been to provide several equational theories for most of these graphical languages, making them complete for various fragments of pure quantum mechanics. We address the question of the extension of these languages beyond pure quantum mechanics, in order to reason on mixed states and general quantum operations, i.e. completely positive maps. Intuitively, such an extension relies on the axiomatisation of a discard map which allows one to get rid of a quantum system, operation which is not allowed in pure quantum mechanics. We introduce a new construction, the discard construction, which transforms any dagger-symmetric monoidal category into a symmetric monoidal category equipped with a discard map. Roughly speaking this construction consists in making any isometry causal. Using this construction we provide an extension for several graphical languages that we prove to be complete for general quantum operations. However this construction fails for some fringe cases like the Clifford+T quantum mechanics, as the category does not have enough isometries.},

Yet entanglement makes protocols presented in Dirac notation difficult to verify. This is why Coecke and Duncan have introduced a diagrammatic language for quantum protocols, called the ZX-calculus. This diagrammatic notation is both intuitive and formally rigorous. It is a simple, graphical, high level language that emphasises the composition of systems and naturally captures the essentials of quantum mechanics. In the author's MSc thesis it has been shown for over 25 quantum protocols that the ZX-calculus provides a relatively easy and more intuitive presentation. Moreover, the author embarked on the task to apply categorical quantum mechanics on quantum security; earlier works did not touch anything but Bennett and Brassard's quantum key distribution protocol, BB84. Superdense coding with the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and quantum key distribution with the W-state are presented in the ZX-calculus in this paper.},

    abstract = {The ZX-calculus is an intuitive but also mathematically strict graphical language for quantum computing, which is especially powerful for the framework of quantum circuits. Completeness of the ZX-calculus means any equality of matrices with size powers of n can be derived purely diagrammatically. In this thesis, we give the first complete axiomatisation the ZX-calculus for the overall pure qubit quantum mechanics, via a translation from the completeness result of another graphical language for quantum computing– the ZW-calculus. This paves the way for automated pictorial quantum computing, with the aid of some software like Quantomatic.

    Based on this universal completeness, we directly obtain a complete axiomatisation of the ZX-calculus for the Clifford+T quantum mechanics, which is approximatively universal for quantum computing, by restricting the ring of complex numbers to its subring corresponding to the Clifford+T fragment resting on the completeness theorem of the ZW-calculus for arbitrary commutative ring.

    Furthermore, we prove the completeness of the ZX-calculus (with just 9 rules) for 2-qubit Clifford+T circuits by verifying the complete set of 17 circuit relations in diagrammatic rewriting. This is an important step towards efficient simplification of general n-qubit Clifford+T circuits, considering that we now have all the necessary rules for diagrammatical quantum reasoning and a very simple construction of Toffoli gate within our axiomatisation framework, which is approximately universal for quantum computation together with the Hadamard gate.

    In addition to completeness results within the qubit related formalism, we extend the completeness of the ZX-calculus for qubit stabilizer quantum mechanics to the qutrit stabilizer system.

    Finally, we show with some examples the application of the ZX-calculus to the proof of generalised supplementarity, the representation of entanglement classification and Toffoli gate, as well as equivalence-checking for the UMA gate.},

The arrays of complex numbers are kin to the arrays of 0s and 1s of the early days of computer programming practice. In this review we present steps towards a diagrammatic `high-level' alternative for the Hilbert space formalism, one which appeals to our intuition. It allows for intuitive reasoning about interacting quantum systems, and trivialises many otherwise involved and tedious computations. It clearly exposes limitations such as the no-cloning theorem, and phenomena such as quantum teleportation. As a logic, it supports `automation'. It allows for a wider variety of underlying theories, and can be easily modified, having the potential to provide the required step-stone towards a deeper conceptual understanding of quantum theory, as well as its unification with other physical theories. Specific applications discussed here are purely diagrammatic proofs of several quantum computational schemes, as well as an analysis of the structural origin of quantum non-locality. The underlying mathematical foundation of this high-level diagrammatic formalism relies on so-called monoidal categories, a product of a fairly recent development in mathematics. These monoidal categories do not only provide a natural foundation for physical theories, but also for proof theory, logic, programming languages, biology, cooking, ... The challenge is to discover the necessary additional pieces of structure that allow us to predict genuine quantum phenomena.}

In this paper we expose the algebraic and graphical structure of the GHZ-state and the W-state, as well as a purely graphical distinction that characterises the behaviours of these states. In turn, this structure yields a compositional graphical model for expressing general multipartite states. 
    We identify those states, named Frobenius states, which canonically induce an algebraic structure, namely the structure of a commutative Frobenius algebra (CFA). We show that all SLOCC-maximal tripartite qubit states are locally equivalent to Frobenius states. Those that are SLOCC-equivalent to the GHZ-state induce special commutative Frobenius algebras, while those that are SLOCC-equivalent to the W-state induce what we call anti-special commutative Frobenius algebras. From the SLOCC-classification of tripartite qubit states follows a representation theorem for two dimensional CFAs. 
    Together, a GHZ and a W Frobenius state form the primitives of a graphical calculus. This calculus is expressive enough to generate and reason about arbitrary multipartite states, which are obtained by "composing" the GHZ- and W-states, giving rise to a rich graphical paradigm for general multipartite entanglement.}

We discover that viewed within our framework these theories are very similar, but differ in one key aspect - a four element group we term the phase group which emerges naturally within our framework. In the case of the stabiliser theory this group is Z4 while for Spekkens's toy theory the group is Z2 x Z2. We further show that the structure of this group is intimately involved in a key physical difference between the theories: whether or not they can be modelled by a local hidden variable theory. This is done by establishing a connection between the phase group, and an abstract notion of GHZ state correlations. We go on to formulate precisely how the stabiliser theory and toy theory are `similar' by defining a notion of `mutually unbiased qubit theory', noting that all such theories have four element phase groups. Since Z4 and Z2 x Z2 are the only such groups we conclude that the GHZ correlations in this type of theory can only take two forms, exactly those appearing in the stabiliser theory and in Spekkens's toy theory. The results point at a classification of local/non-local behaviours by finite Abelian groups, extending beyond qubits to finitary theories whose observables are all mutually unbiased.},

In particular, we establish a direct connection between Mermin-type non-locality scenarios, which we generalise to an arbitrary number of parties, using systems of arbitrary dimension, and performing arbitrary measurements, and a new stronger notion of complementarity which we introduce here. 
    Our derivation of the fact that strong complementarity is a necessary condition for a Mermin scenario provides a crisp operational interpretation for strong complementarity. We also provide a complete classification of strongly complementary observables for quantum theory, something which has not yet been achieved for ordinary complementarity. 
    Since our main results are expressed in the (diagrammatic) language of dagger-compact categories, they can be applied outside of quantum theory, in any setting which supports the purely algebraic notion of strongly complementary observables. We have therefore introduced a method for discussing non-locality in a wide variety of models in addition to quantum theory. 
    The diagrammatic calculus substantially simplifies (and sometimes even trivialises) many of the derivations, and provides new insights. In particular, the diagrammatic computation of correlations clearly shows how local measurements interact to yield a global overall effect. In other words, we depict non-locality.}

Thanks to a system of back-and-forth translation between the ZX-Calculus and a third-party complete graphical language, we prove that the provided axiomatisation is complete for the first approximately universal fragment of the language, namely Clifford+T. We then prove that the expressive power of this presentation, though aimed at achieving completeness for the aforementioned restriction, extends beyond Clifford+T, to a class of diagrams that we call linear with Clifford+T constants. We use another version of the third-party language - and an adapted system of back-and-forth translation - to complete the language for the ZX-Calculus as a whole, that is, with no restriction. We briefly discuss the added axioms, and finally, we provide a complete axiomatisation for an altered version of the language which involves an additional generator, making the presentation simpler.}

However, there has been a lack of sufficiently powerful high-level languages to describe computing in this form without resorting to single-qubit operations, which quickly become prohibitively complex as the system size increases. In this paper we apply the category-theoretic work of Abramsky and Coecke to the topological cluster-state model of quantum computing to give a high-level graphical language that enables direct translation between quantum processes and physical patterns of measurement in a computer - a "compiler language". We give the equivalence between the graphical and topological information flows, and show the applicable rewrite algebra for this computing model. We show that this gives us a native graphical language for the design and analysis of topological quantum algorithms, and finish by discussing the possibilities for automating this process on a large scale.}

We present a new method for reducing the number of T-gates in a quantum circuit based on the ZX-calculus, which matches or beats previous approaches to T-count reduction on the majority of our benchmark circuits in the ancilla-free case, in some cases yielding up to 50\% improvement. Our method begins by representing the quantum circuit as a ZX-diagram, a tensor network-like structure that can be transformed and simplified according to the rules of the ZX-calculus. We then show that a recently-proposed simplification strategy can be extended to reduce T-count using a new technique called phase teleportation. This technique allows non-Clifford phases to combine and cancel by propagating non-locally through a generic quantum circuit. Phase teleportation does not change the number or location of non-phase gates and the method also applies to arbitrary non-Clifford phase gates as well as gates with unknown phase parameters in parametrised circuits. Furthermore, the simplification strategy we use is powerful enough to validate equality of many circuits. In particular, we use it to show that our optimised circuits are indeed equal to the original ones. We have implemented the routines of this paper in the open-source library PyZX.}

    abstract = {The ZX-calculus is a graphical language for reasoning about ZX-diagrams, a tensor network-like language that can represent arbitrary linear maps between qubits. Using the ZX-calculus, we can intuitively reason about quantum mechanics, and optimise and validate quantum circuits. In this paper we introduce PyZX, an open source library for automated reasoning with large ZX-diagrams. We give a brief introduction to the ZX-calculus, then show how PyZX implements methods for circuit optimisation, equality validation, and visualisation and how it can be used in tandem with other software. We end with a set of challenges that when solved would expand the power of automated diagrammatic reasoning.}

The original version of the calculus, which allows every generator to be labelled by an arbitrary complex number, was shown to be complete by Backens and Kissinger. Even though the calculus is complete, this does not mean it allows one to easily reason in restricted settings such as is the case in quantum computing. In this paper we study the fragment of the ZH-calculus that is phase-free, and thus is closer aligned to physically implementable maps. We present a modified rule-set for the phase-free ZH-calculus and show that it is complete. We further discuss the minimality of this rule-set and we give an intuitive interpretation of the rules. Our completeness result follows by reducing to Vilmart's rule-set for the phase-free $\Delta$ZX-calculus. }

In this paper, we will show that the two calculi are linked by Fourier transform. In particular, we will derive new Fourier expansion rules using the ZH-calculus, and show that we can straightforwardly pass between ZH- and ZX-diagrams using them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the graphical Fourier expansion of a ZH normal-form corresponds to the standard Fourier transform of a semi-Boolean function. As an illustration of the calculational power of this technique, we then show that several tricks for reducing the T-gate cost of Toffoli circuits, which include for instance quantum adders, can be derived using graphical Fourier theory and straightforwardly generalized to more qubits.}

    abstract = {Many physical implementations of quantum computers impose stringent memory constraints in which 2-qubit operations can only be performed between qubits which are nearest neighbours in a lattice or graph structure. Hence, before a computation can be run on such a device, it must be mapped onto the physical architecture. That is, logical qubits must be assigned physical locations in the quantum memory, and the circuit must be replaced by an equivalent one containing only operations between nearest neighbours. In this paper, we give a new technique for quantum circuit mapping (a.k.a. routing), based on Gaussian elimination constrained to certain optimal spanning trees called Steiner trees. We give a reference implementation of the technique for CNOT circuits and show that it significantly out-performs general-purpose routines on CNOT circuits. We then comment on how the technique can be extended straightforwardly to the synthesis of CNOT+Rz circuits and as a modification to a recently-proposed circuit simplification/extraction procedure for generic circuits based on the ZX-calculus. }

    abstract = {While multipartite entanglement is a crucial resource for many quantum algorithms and protocols, the abstract, structural rules governing it are still not fully understood. In their recent paper, Coecke and Kissinger propose a new language called GHZ/W-calculus that aims to give a structural axiomatization of multipartite entanglement in terms of interacting ``special'' and ``anti-special'' commutative Frobenius algebras (S/A-CFAs). These algebraic structures correspond precisely to the two different types of genuine entanglement between three qubits, as given by inter-convertability by stochastic local (quantum) operations and classical communication (SLOCC). An important feature of the language is that it lives in the framework of categorical quantum mechanics and thus comes with a Penrose-Joyal-Street graphical calulus. This thesis explores the expressive power of the GHZ/W-calculus. We prove a new result that demonstrates the canonicity of the recent concept of antispeciality for CFAs and use it to give a new classification of Frobenius Algebras on $\mathbb{C}^2$ in FdHilb, the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps. Next, we look at the non-standard model of categorical quantum mechanics given by FRel, the category of finite sets and binary relations. We classify all special CFAs in this category, prove some properties of anti-special ones and identify precisely which SCFAs/ACFAs are captured by the GHZ/W-language. Finally, we define a quantum AND gate in the graphical language and prove (or disprove) some of its properties. We come to the conclusion that the GHZ/W-calculus is unlikely to be the final answer to the structural entanglement problem in dimensions $D > 2$ and identify intermediate ranks $1 < rank < D$ as the notion it fails to explain.}

These operations have non-deterministic heralded effects, similarly to measurement-based quantum computation. We describe sufficient conditions for Pauli Fusion procedures to be deterministically realisable, so that it performs a given transformation independently of its non-deterministic outcomes. This provides an operational model to realise ZX terms beyond the circuit model.}

All of these languages use certain diagrammatic decorations, called !-boxes and phase variables, to indicate not just one diagram but an infinite family of diagrams. In this same manner one can express infinite families of equations between diagrams, and these decorations are powerful enough to allow for complete rulesets expressing any equivalence in pure state qubit quantum mechanics. We present here results that show that equations between separable infinite families of diagrams are finitely verifiable; that is to say that to verify these infinite families of equations it suffices to check a finite subset of that family, provided a condition we call separability is met. The results we present in this paper not only construct such a verifying subfamily directly, but also generalise to any diagrammatic calculus that satisfies certain simple conditions.}

The ZX-calculus is, however, a low level language, with each wire representing a single qubit. This limits its ability to handle large and elaborate quantum evolutions. We extend the ZX-calculus to registers of qubits and allow compact representation of sub-diagrams via binary matrices. We show soundness and completeness of the SZX-calculus and provide two examples of applications, for graph states and error correcting codes.}

We provide the necessary and sufficient condition for a Hopf algebra to be a Hopf-Frobenius algebra, and show that every Hopf algebra in $\textbf{FVect}_\text{k}$ is a Hopf-Frobenius algebra. Hopf-Frobenius algebras provide a notion of duality, and give us a "dual" Hopf algebra that is isomorphic to the usual dual Hopf algebra in a compact closed category. We use this isomorphism to construct a Hopf algebra isomorphic to the Drinfeld double that is defined on $H\otimes H$ rather than $H\otimes H^*$.}

  abstract = {Recently, a novel GHZ/W graphical calculus has been established to study and reason more intuitively about interacting quantum systems. The compositional structure of this calculus was shown to be well‐equipped to sufficiently express arbitrary mutlipartite quantum states equivalent under stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC). However, it is still not clear how to explicitly identify which graphical properties lead to what states. This can be achieved if we have well‐behaved normal forms for arbitrary graphs within this calculus. This article lays down a first attempt at realizing such normal forms for a restricted class of such graphs, namely simple and regular graphs. These results should pave the way for the most general cases as part of future work.}
