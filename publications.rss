Completeness guarantees that any true equation on quantum circuits can be derived from the equational theory. Our contribution is twofold: (i) We simplify this equational theory by proving that several rules can be derived from the remaining ones. In particular, two out of the three most intricate rules are removed, the third one being slightly simplified. (ii) We extend the complete equational theory to quantum circuits with ancillae or qubit discarding, to represent respectively quantum computations using an additional workspace, and hybrid quantum computations. We show that the remaining intricate rule can be greatly simplified in these more expressive settings. The development of simple and complete equational theories for expressive quantum circuit models opens new avenues for reasoning about quantum circuits. It provides strong formal foundations for various compiling tasks such as circuit optimisation, hardware constraint satisfaction and verification.</description><author>Alexandre Clément, Noé Delorme, Simon Perdrix and Renaud Vilmart</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03117</guid></item><item><title>Basic ZX-calculus for students and professionals</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03163</link><description>These are the lecture notes of guest lectures for Artur Ekert's course Introduction to Quantum Information at the Mathematical Institute of Oxford University, Hilary Term 2023.

We perform a pre-processing step classically, which reduces the dimensionality of the problem by generating a custom mapping which excludes states which violate problem constraints. Subsequently, a specialized measurement scheme is used to extract the expectation value of the problem Hamiltonian through this mapping. We demonstrate that this method reduces the amount of quantum resources needed to run a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm without making any approximations to the physics of the quantum chemistry problem.</description><author>Kaur Kristjuhan and Mark Nicholas Jones</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01122</guid></item><item><title>Oblivious Transfer from Zero-Knowledge Proofs, or How to Achieve Round-Optimal Quantum Oblivious Transfer and Zero-Knowledge Proofs on Quantum States</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01476</link><description>We provide a generic construction to turn any classical Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocol into a composable (quantum) oblivious transfer (OT) protocol, mostly lifting the round-complexity properties and security guarantees (plain-model/statistical security/unstructured functions...) of the ZK protocol to the resulting OT protocol. Such a construction is unlikely to exist classically as Cryptomania is believed to be different from Minicrypt.   In particular, by instantiating our construction using Non-Interactive ZK (NIZK), we provide the first round-optimal (2-message) quantum OT protocol secure in the random oracle model, and round-optimal extensions to string and k-out-of-n OT.   At the heart of our construction lies a new method that allows us to prove properties on a received quantum state without revealing (too much) information on it, even in a non-interactive way and/or with statistical guarantees when using an appropriate classical ZK protocol. We can notably prove that a state has been partially measured (with arbitrary constraints on the set of measured qubits), without revealing any additional information on this set. This notion can be seen as an analog of ZK to quantum states, and we expect it to be of independent interest as it extends complexity theory to quantum languages, as illustrated by the two new complexity classes we introduce, ZKstateQIP and ZKstateQMA.</description><author>Léo Colisson, Garazi Muguruza and Florian Speelman</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01476</guid></item><item><title>Completeness for arbitrary finite dimensions of ZXW-calculus, a unifying calculus</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12135</link><description>The ZX-calculus is a universal graphical language for qubit quantum computation, meaning that every linear map between qubits can be expressed in the ZX-calculus. Furthermore, it is a complete graphical rewrite system: any equation involving linear maps that is derivable in the Hilbert space formalism for quantum theory can also be derived in the calculus by rewriting. It has widespread usage within quantum industry and academia for a variety of tasks such as quantum circuit optimisation, error-correction, and education.   The ZW-calculus is an alternative universal graphical language that is also complete for qubit quantum computing. In fact, its completeness was used to prove that the ZX-calculus is universally complete. This calculus has advanced how quantum circuits are compiled into photonic hardware architectures in the industry.   Recently, by combining these two calculi, a new calculus has emerged for qubit quantum computation, the ZXW-calculus. Using this calculus, graphical-differentiation, -integration, and -exponentiation were made possible, thus enabling the development of novel techniques in the domains of quantum machine learning and quantum chemistry.   Here, we generalise the ZXW-calculus to arbitrary finite dimensions, that is, to qudits. Moreover, we prove that this graphical rewrite system is complete for any finite dimension. This is the first completeness result for any universal graphical language beyond qubits.</description><author>Boldizsár Poór, Quanlong Wang, Razin Shaikh A., Lia Yeh, Richie Yeung and Bob Coecke</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12135</guid></item><item><title>Compositionality of planar perfect matchings</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08767</link><description>We exhibit a strong connection between the matchgate formalism introduced by Valiant and the ZW-calculus of Coecke and Kissinger. This connection provides a natural compositional framework for matchgate theory as well as a direct combinatorial interpretation of the diagrams of ZW-calculus through the perfect matchings of their underlying graphs.   We identify a precise fragment of ZW-calculus, the planar W-calculus, that we prove to be complete and universal for matchgates, that are linear maps satisfying the matchgate identities. Computing scalars of the planar W-calculus corresponds to counting perfect matchings of planar graphs, and so can be carried in polynomial time using the FKT algorithm, making the planar W-calculus an efficiently simulable fragment of the ZW-calculus, in a similar way that the Clifford fragment is for ZX-calculus. This work opens new directions for the investigation of the combinatorial properties of ZW-calculus as well as the study of perfect matching counting through compositional diagrammatical technics.</description><author>Titouan Carette, Etienne Moutot, Thomas Perez and Renaud Vilmart</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08767</guid></item><item><title>Complete Graphical Language for Hermiticity-Preserving Superoperators</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04212</link><description>Universal and complete graphical languages have been successfully designed for pure state quantum mechanics, corresponding to linear maps between Hilbert spaces, and mixed states quantum mechanics, corresponding to completely positive superoperators. In this paper, we go one step further and present a universal and complete graphical language for Hermiticity-preserving superoperators. Such a language opens the possibility of diagrammatic compositional investigations of antilinear transformations featured in various physical situations, such as the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism, spin-flip, or entanglement witnesses. Our construction relies on an extension of the ZW-calculus exhibiting a normal form for Hermitian matrices.</description><author>Titouan Carette, Timothée Hoffreumon, Emile Larroque and Renaud Vilmart</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04212</guid></item><item><title>Cutting multi-control quantum gates with ZX calculus</title><link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00387</link><description>Circuit cutting, the decomposition of a quantum circuit into independent partitions, has become a promising avenue towards experiments with larger quantum circuits in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. While previous work focused on cutting qubit wires or two-qubit gates, in this work we introduce a method for cutting multi-controlled Z gates. We construct a decomposition and prove the upper bound $\mathcalO(6^2K)$ on the associated sampling overhead, where $K$ is the number of cuts in the circuit. This bound is independent of the number of control qubits but can be further reduced to $\mathcalO(4.5^2K)$ for the special case of CCZ gates. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposal on IBM hardware and experimentally show noise resilience due to the strong reduction of CNOT gates in the cut circuits.</description><author>Christian Ufrecht, Maniraman Periyasamy, Sebastian Rietsch, Daniel D.

As well as describing a surgery operation, this gives a general recipe for new codes. As an application we describe how to `merge' and `split' along a shared $øverlineX$ or $øverlineZ$ operator between arbitrary CSS codes in a fault-tolerant manner, so long as the participating qubits satisfy a technical condition related to gauge fixing. We prove that such merges and splits on LDPC codes yield codes which are themselves LDPC.</description><author>Alexander Cowtan and Simon Burton</author><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13738</guid></item><item><title>Towards a Curry-Howard Correspondence for Quantum Computation</title><link>https://theses.hal.science/tel-03959403/document</link><description>In this thesis, we are interested in the development of a Curry-Howard correspondence for quantum computing, allowing to represent quantum types and quantum control-flow. In the standard model of Quantum Computation, a classical computer is linked to a quantum coprocessor. The classical computer can then send instructions to allocate, update, or read quantum registers. The programs executed by the coprocessor are represented by a quantum circuit: a sequence of instructions that applies unitary operations to the input quantum bits. While the model is universal, in the sense that it can represent any unitary operations, it stays limited: it lacks of proper representation of non-causal execution flow. Normally, to represent branching, one can use a type system featuring a coproduct, allowing for the choice between two possible executions, but quantum circuits only feature qubits and tensors thereof. On the other hand, types and strongly related to logic via the Curry-Howard correspondence which states that types of programs correspond to formulas and programs to proofs, while the program evaluation is matched with the proof simplification. While this correspondence has been extended to multiple setting in classical computer, it has yet to emerge in quantum computing. To address those problems we follow two different approaches: the first one, through the development of a linear and reversible programming language, capturing a subset of quantum computing, along with a Curry-Howard correspondence with the logic µMALL. The language comes in two versions: one representing exactly complete, reversible functions while the other one can represent partial functions. Both version comes with an expressivity result: in the former, one can capture the whole class of Primitive Recursive Functions, while in the later any Turing Machine we show how to capture any Turing Machine. The second approach follows the development of token-based semantics, inspired by Girard’s Geometry of Interaction, for graphical language for quantum computation. In this approach, a token-based semantics was given for the ZX-Calculus: a graphical language for quantum computation capable of representing any linear operators. We show how the token-based semantics matches the denotational one. We extend the ZX-Calculus with a coproduct and an explicit tensor in the development of the Many-Worlds Calculus. This new languages comes with a token-based semantics and an equational theory. We show how quantum control can be represented in this system. Finally, the programming language is modified to be able to realize pure quantum computation and the graphical language is then used as a denotational model for it. </description><author>Kostia Chardonnet</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theses.hal.science/tel-03959403/document</guid></item></channel></rss>
